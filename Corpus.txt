First thing want to ask is if you remember any books that you read as child um or either books that were read to you either by teacher or your parents or grandparents that you really remember enjoyin
How about stories that uh you didn't read or weren't read to you but stories you know how people come up with stories mean is there any were there any particular stories that people told you that you really liked hearing when you were growing up Not that can remember no uh u
Do you remember anything that um mean there are always books that liked always had to read everything but uh there were certain things that liked more than others do remember anything you liked in particular um about stuff you had to read maybe in your English class or um things like that Nothin
Well what about now like um Thanksgiving's coming up and families get together for that and for Christmas when when you are um you know eating dinner or you know just talking and everythin
Are there particular stories either either family stories that you might tell or stories about um you know things that have happened to people in the past Or maybe stories that you know some people just make up stories to tel
Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing u
Anything in particular Well do you remember one of those particular stories that um might come up when you're just sitting around reminiscing Well lot of times we had company ove
He dia diagnosed me as having acute leukemia and um this was when lived back in Raleig
And uh Momma and took trips back and forth to Chapel Hill and went through couple of treatments and uh you know uh uh had had to have different shots each time went bac
It was and the little remember Momma telling me on the way you know just little things don't know really let me think no
guess was in wing of the hospital where five or six other children in that whole wing of the hospital well in that that wing and everybody went through the same treatment
Turned out after all the treatments were done was the only survivor in the particular wing of the hospita
Well you know to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and the
So when when that comes up does is your mom primarily the one who would tell it or your dad Bot
It's just one of those things that you know you just don't think people want to hear much about these day
And it was one afternoon was out playing on the uh sidewalk and uh Mom was Mom was in the kitchen doing something and was guess pretending to act like salesman and went up to the front door and rang the doorbel
And Mom came to the door and uh she saw like this glow of light all around me as if the Lord had definitely cured me of leukemi
Would you say that um your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story tells that part of the story the the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end Beginning to en
Um do you remember everything that your mom like when she's telling the story do you remember everything she tells or is some of it you remember and some of it you don't pretty much remember the whole thin
And uh remember exactly going to the hospital and the uh waiting room but um yeah it's just something you don't know anybody goes throug
have told it to several other people like my coworkers and to this day they can't believe it they would have never know
was on this earth you know I've lived on this earth for some reason just don't know what it is ye
Well as far as being story this is not an ordinary story that every family tells obviously some do um is it something that comes up lot or is it you know something that your family doesn't talk about lot or is it something that comes up on pretty regular basis Maybe once in whil
OK well um are there any particular stories related to this or anything else you enjoy reading now or um mean is there anything looking at what you experienced is there anything any type of stories that you like to read now or that you like to hear about now Maybe other people who survived leukemia or other diseases that you know were life threatening like that or mean do you ever try to find out other people's experiences do enjoy reading the um stories related to Guideposts or uh what's another Reader's Digest they come i
When cancer comes up I'm just pretty pretty interested in it to find out what they went through and can relate to i
And so what year does that make you are you a I'm just finishing up my freshman year in colleg
And did you find that to be kind of hard or did you know Wha yeah very hard compared to high schoo
It was Um now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to go to school Um wanted to be closer to my family number one and um number two have lot of friends coming here which helped me lot and um just liked the Charlotte um UNC Charlotte because wanted to be a nurs
What have you decided what are you going to do I'm going to do Education no
For any particular reason or you just like the area Um like this area whole lot and it's it's growing so much and just want to be near my family so can take care of them whenever they get olde
So are they happy that you're going to be teacher Or do would they rather you have stay in Nursing They would rather me stay in Nursing because they know that's where my heart is but um you know they're behind me in whatever decide to d
Do you feel like you did well this sem this year or if you had to do it over what would you do differently wish could take back my whole freshman yea
wish if could do it all over again would stay home and study instead of going out with my friends which has really hurt me lo
Do you think that's what it was Was it the freedom aspect of it or Definitely the freedom definitely the freedo
But here in college you don't have mean you can do what you want to come and go as you pleas
And I've learned um at the end of this year how to manage my time which hasn't helped me out very muc
If don't then probably won't come back to this school anymore which don't want that because love this school love the friends that I've made here everything about this this place lov
He's they're like they're not disappointed but they just know that could do whole lot bette
So you're just going to work lot harder Work lot harder um take some classes that think are going to interest me mor
That's one thing about this school is they just give you like certain classes to take and they don't let you pick and choose what you want to take and stuf
So you felt like you didn't even have anybody there to guide you have nobody here to guide m
was pretty much you know on my own and I'm not used to that because in high school Righ
They would guide you and kind of show you what you need to do and stuff Yea
Do you feel like that's just in Charlotte that that's how the school systems are Or do you feel like in general that's how high school is as opposed to college feel like it's that way everywher
Is there anything else you want to Oh no Don't get nervous Is there anything else you want to talk about or is that pretty much all you had to say That's pretty much i
I'm just going to tell everybody that they need to study Definitely study And work har
You can go out on the weekends but during the week it you know it should be study tim
Um we're going to talk about today childhood stories and what I'm wondering is what are the stories you remember as children recall number of storie
Uncle Wiggly What was that about That's about rabbit and about farmer that used to chase the rabbit out of his uh carrot patch and uh all the characters that were associated with tha
Was that your favorite story think that's one remember lot because when was in 1st grade was sick lot of the year and was out of school lot of the yea
And uh because of that my mother read to me lot you know to help me me feel better So she uh she read lot of Uncle Wiggly stories to m
But think the story that was was favorite was one that my mother made up herself utilizing characters from you know like Bugs Bunny and and Thumper and Bambi and all tha
And ah she she made it up story about a me and my cousin Phil ah going on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters uh while we were ther
Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted but my mother made up the story and thought it was very nice and still have it uh handwritten uh in our file her
OK how about you Mom remember uhem Peter Cottontail and the farmer chasing him under the wire and Peter Cottontail getting out just in tim
Of course who knew about Disney World hundred years ago but um Mickey Mouse was favorit
And um Little Women that was and now had three older sisters and always kind of envisioned us patterned after Little Women and because there were four girls in that family and loved that story; read it over and over agai
Well what was your favorite story If you had to pick out of all of them My favorite story um oh Cinderell
just loved Cinderella also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes and was Cinderella running around waiting on the
What ah story in your childhood had the most impact on you I'll ask you first Mom and then Da
Ohum most impact on me think Oh Heidi loved Heidi and that in fact wanted to name one of my children Heidi because loved Heidi of the Alp
Um as far as having an impact on me guess uh being good girl and doing all the right thing
Those were the stories read OK Dad want to tell What's your favorite Well I'll tell you there was record Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes and still quote it today when I'm when I'm being funn
And it had to do with the description of all the cowboy paraphernalia that was ah existent at the tim
Like tapaderos that were on the the uh place to protect your boots in the saddle [Laughs and reverts to normal voice'] and all that sort of thin
So remember silly things like that that were lot of fun read uh the story that don't this isn't ah think the first real story that read was uh The Red Badge of Courag
Uh more serious and that was that was very interesting story because it was the first time came upon character who was real who was afraid who ran away who uh then came back and uh and conquered his fear which is something that we all have to do from time to tim
What are your least favorite stories When you're thinking of stories that affected you and really you abhorre
What are those stories Well Aladdin and the Lamp That genie that came out of that lamp scared me half to death Was that told to you or did you read that Um that was told to me and saw that genie coming out of the bottle in the picture in the book was not about kind and loving geni
It was kind of scary looking and thought Ooh don't think I'd like to meet up with that genie Well who told you that story Ooh one of my three older sister
Um when you're talking about your favorite stories what was your favorite part of the story Remember told you about the story my mother wrote and can remember at the time and in some ways it's still true toda
Ah the favorite part of the story was the fact that had somehow bought an old Model For
How appropriate That was the favorite part of the story Well think all the happy endings we read as children Pollyanna you know and uh everything always seemed to turn out righ
 What were your least favorite parts of the story What parts of the story were boring Oh In Little Women when Meg died Oh dear That was so traumatic and ah Swiss Family Robinso
They made home out of out of things they found on the island fashioned things oh uh implements uh out of coconut shells and whatever stones and whatever they could fin
Did you identify with any of these characters And what's the one you identified with the most Well think identified with J
She was kind of headstrong and she was um kind of artistic maybe and uh uh liked to have good sense of humo
Yeah the main I The Red Badge of Courage the main character at first had never you know all of the cowboy stories that saw or read it was uh uh you know the good the bad and the good were very good and the bad were very ba
So didn't like that at first and then of course you know as the story unfolded you would uh relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thin
So thought it was uh uh it was at first part of the story didn't like but afterward uh you know it certainly taught lesso
We're talking lot about childhood stories and stories that um were read to you and what were the first what did you start reading when you were first allowed to choose what you read What did you choose Well chose to read the ones that had been read to m
We had great big book of Grimm's Fairytales and looking back on that they were grim They were scary throwing child in the oven and all that sort of thing However it didn't seem to be so horrifyin
It was story and I you know you knew it was fiction but would go back and read when could read myself read everythin
Classic comics yeah Uh well yeah and remember Ivanhoe and uh The Disinherited Knight and all that kind of thin
I'm talking to you as your you know my Mom and Dad and uh what were if you know what were your Mom and Dad's favorite stories My father read uh liked history and read um lot of historical uh factual things not into fiction at al
Uh my mother was probably so busy running around taking care of all of us guess she read um think she read biographical things rather than um novel
My father didn't read anything in terms of what you'd call book uh but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings and so would peruse the paper to check on that But uh my mother uh you know didn't read whole lot but spent lot of time reading to me uh my being an only chil
Uh so yeah took up lot of her life and she read lot of children's stories to me as result of that but don't believe she read lot for her own amusemen
So um you know it was different people would read for different reasons and think your mother has um you know she's educated herself at the librar
We're talking lot about stories and um novels and children's books was there any poetry that was your favorite Golly never really got into poetr
Yeah had to take it as children Or high school just really didn't ever love poetry for some reaso
still recall and I'm sure your mother does too Whose woods these are think know His house is in the village though; and won't go beyond that but uh you recall that Gail when we were when was in college and we were first dating that was a favorite poem of uh us and our friend
Um and we're talking about childhood and middle school what about high school What about high school into college into adulthood what are some of the books that you read Oh ge
Um Can we turn that off while think One in particular read while in college that we just howled over and that was Catcher in the Rye by J
Um Peyton Place was had um kind of fascination because was at summer camp in NH near Gilmanton Iron Works where that woman the author live
So that was such racy and shocking book at that time and so of course we had to read i
liked uh oh gosh go ahead Dave you've got Well remember another book that you read that that didn't read but that uh painting was made 84 Oh Ayn Rand Yeah um And remember that being appearing to be so far in the futur
Oh yes and George Orwell books read uh uh um 1984 and what's the other one Animal Farm and they yeah it was so far in the future and my gosh now it's the pas
Whew Into adulthood what books do you like now like uh political nonfiction and I've read The Making of the President series from 1960 on u
I like uh uh those kinds of things that talk about why people do what they do when they're in positions of political power or aspiring to positions of political powe
I've read all the the lawyer books Grisham and Turow and lot of the um current uh writers novelist
Um oh gosh Anita Shrever is one um Rosamunde Pilcher Maeve Binchy um like all of that type of readin
Have you ever read any books from foreign authors Somebody who obviously that English was not their first language but they wrote book Um I'm sure have just can't think of wha
And and years later we ended up living in the place where that took place and the uh and it was not something that was uh not subject that people liked to talk about because many of the people in town knew the young man who was charged with that murde
Did you notice any differences between an American writer and someone of foreign descent Oh well the cultural differences would come through in the writing yeah sur
Well I'm going to ask final question that um mean you're my parents and you imparted lot of uh lot of the love of reading to m
Uh how important it was to read and we're all English majors think that has something to do with it; my brother sister and are all we're all English majors in colleg
So what am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that Why is reading so important can't imagine not readin
can't imagine not reading and for pure enjoyment and uh for growth broadening your knowledge bas
What sad thing if people can't read If had if was retired would definitely be working in aliteracy um you know volunteer literacy capacit
think uh that intellectual stimulation is very important think thinking is very important think reading is part of tha
And I uh too often much too often see people um feeling superior somehow because they don't read they don't think they don't experience other idea
And so uh those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or uh gazing on T
Well thank you for being part of this study Our pleasure Thank you How should start However you lik
always had to get up early milk the cows and uh run run them as we say because it's a to the pastures until times got pretty bad and one day sent my daughter to to the pasture to bring in the cow
We brought them back in the afternoon when saw that behind her there came big group of they looked like soldiers but in street clothe
Then she cam my daughter came almost green pale and she said to me Mama she said to me Those are guerrillas That was the first time saw them the gue the guerilla
At about about three weeks later then arrived group of about four at my brother's house and told him that they were coming to to be that is to take control of the place where we live
Well but that they weren't going to steal they weren't going to kill neither would they harm the people but it we didn't if we worked with the
But if we didn't want to work with them we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil military such as informing on them or something like tha
Then when well since lived alone only with my son they would seek me out because always had everything because had all kinds of animals including doves from Castile uh turkeys ducks hens pigs cows all kinds of animal
So they would they would always come to me and they told me Ma'am sell us milk sell us yogurt sell us cheese or sell us a hog plump hog well had to sell them and am going to sell he'd said if you sell them to everyone else sell to us too say to him OK And that's how kept on working and with the
They there well they'd come from time to time to buy things until one day well they already had been there for several years when all of sudden along came young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose they call him Chepon because he was tall white and al
So he he came looking for yogurt don't know what he came looking for for me to sell hi

And said to him And what is that for Because they're going to set up committee he said to me so that when those big battalions he said to me of guerrillas arrive these people attend for example the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for the
He says Yes because you have less children and can have more time or more ability to get around to the people so they will help out And said to him Yes President of what They call it he said The Committee of Forsaken Mothers said Really Yes he sai
So said No said I'm not going to be able to go He said But don't you ever tell that told you because he sai

When he came back he said Yes so he said I'm going to leave here he said from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock And that's how it was he left at dawn and he said See you there and he left with the with the livestock with the and the the others who were going to hel
stayed at home finishing straightening up and the neighbors Pedro's boys already took my things to town and we left for Chapeltiqu
We arrived at my brother's and Cristobal with the livestock and the rest still hadn't arrive
After worked there then that went to San Miguel because my daughter also had she needed m
And kept on and finally when saw that life was really expensive and didn't have couldn't work anymore since I'm not professional then decided to come to the US because also well the there in that area since now there wasn't anywhere to work had left hidden from the guerrillas and well that's what continue
Well and forgot to tell you when the soldiers came to my house the guerrillas were there the guerrillas went bac
It was when the first one arrived the first soldier and he said Er ma'am make he said some four six rations he said because plenty of soldiers have come and I'm going to inform the other houses stayed making the rations of food when group of soldiers arrives and when was fixing the food in the kitchen because of the sun because of the reflection of the sun saw weapon pointing at me so that was when said to him What happened And he said Don't play the soldier said don't play he said innocent he said in that house I our house is huge and stayed locked up because just me and my son lived my baby son tiny and me and well that's al
And said I don't have anybody said hidden away He says Don't let it happen to you like the people in Ateltisate that was another area where we did away with the place because they covered up the guerrillas told him I don't cover up anybody sai
Then with me at gunpoint two behind followed me so opened the door and there was nothing in the house thank God because there was no one ther
Then since then I was like when saw military felt like I I that is great fear terror of the guerrillas was afraid of them but the military was wors
Then they the guerrillas passed through this river that divided the countries and it filled up with men when you remembered it it was full like any base And then the soldiers would pass through just the sam
So you couldn't tell what kind at night what kind of people were going by but you could hear clatter because even beasts full of weapons with everything you know So that time that told you about when the the soldiers came my son escaped dying from fear when go that they had me at gunpoint and they surrounded the house but it passed they didn't do anythin
The next time the soldiers came through the guerrillas were in front of the house in the road there's one of those huge rocks that you can sit on and when they were eatin
When all of sudden girl went by was washing clothes girl went by and she told me she was going to here mom's her name is Victori
And when the guerrillas ah well the girl went by and very shortly she came bac
And said Why did you come back Victoria A huge group of soldiers are coming she said I mean huge group she said so I'm going So came in from where was washing went in and didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves because didn't see they were in front but since went it didn't se
Then you know that in order to keep yourself out of trouble you go in and don't then they come or that was another time that suffered terrible threat when the soldiers come throug
And he said Ma'am he said what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves said Sir I've gone in and don't know the house is big and went inside told him I haven't seen anyone He says Look ma'am he says you deserve to have your tongue cut out because you are covering for the guerrillas told him I don't cover for the guerrillas or for you Why would cover for them So he says No from the school up are all guerrillas said The fact you I you can be there said or can stay here and you go in said you don't see where get off to Then they left they left for the mountain they went on u
Then huge throng of soldiers came and they shot over the house that we have to my dad always used to have lot of we call them cercos of of pure ijiote of of made of poles that are nice and fres
Then every little bit since they were shooting those bazookas and who knows what kind of of things and all the tops of the trees were falling they fell and since the roof was made of teja til
But it's like this in plenty of shapes see that here they also have some shaped like tejas to
Are they like rounded No they're long things like this they come down to here and here another one goes on top yes very pretty like like between orange because they're fired they're made of fired cla
Well then the dust from the the tiles was falling because well they were destroying them right Well so many bullets so many thing
Then and the neighbors and niece of mine and cousin lived there and bullets went through my nephew's and he had fiveyearold daughter who was the only one who was there because her mom had gone to bring water and she stayed because of the firefight she also stayed inside so that she wouldn't the little girl locked herself in and thank God she survive
And when then that was the first time that my little boy came down with as if don't know he didn't faint but he he turned purple here [indicates area around her mouth] green and then purple and then he stopped breathing fell to the floo
So then grabbed him and when grabbed him put him under the bed and went outsid
In uh in the window in front we have window facing the street there was guerrilla lying on the ground firing at the soldier
On this other side where the bedroom was went outside and saw him well the size of the flame when the flame from the rif from the bullet came out even with small flame like this told him Please sir get away from here don't you see the danger sai
Redfaced tired and redfaced the man and on the other side the other end of the house there were two others shooting so that also also stretched out on the groun
Then said Dear Lord said what are we going to do about this Well they went through they broke soldier's leg you could hear his moanin
Well one day sai was going from San Miguel uh to Carolina my brother lived my brother was the principal of that of that school there in Carolin
He worked he's teacher and at that time he worked as the principal of that school of that school because it was a like high school there was from first grade to high schoo
So early that morning that afternoon came down from San Miguel and told him I'm going to go He says Don't g
They're making trincheras they call them trincheras where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses so that the bullets ther
He says And it's going to be very dangerous and it's very late So said to him Oh well I'm going to go when it's morning My son was already two not even two years old like like about like year and hal
When all of sudden at daybreak my my brother went to to bring a to the well close by there two jugs of water his wife and he and stayed in the house making coffe
Because in the front of the two the re's mountain that they call El Volcancillo the little volcano belo
It's just that what firefight They were shooting shells bomb even from those bazookas and don't know what kind of weapon
Well he milked the cow every morning but that day he couldn't milk her because the gunfire was so heavy and because everything was falling near the hous
So my brother said I'm going to cut her rope I'm not going to be able to untie her he said Because it's really difficult with by the time untie her they'll kill me he say
I'm going to cut it with the knife the knot so the cow can go and she won't die Then he is when shell like this falls that went into the ground but lo
And the the fragments as they call them cut him here [indicates several parts of body] cut him here cut his here cut him here and don't know where else but there were many but the deepest one was this one He didn't say anythin
We were down had my son under me on the floor Ines had one and Ines brother that is the boy's uncle had the other boy under hi
Well nobody noticed my brother until he said Vieja Old lady he said because that's how they talked to each other Vieja he said I may be going to die and we turned him around to see what the th
He had pillow one of those big pillows and it looked red all of it with blood and swollen like this So he said from the running down from several places but the one that this one [indicates eyebrow] was was too muc
So she said Ines went out and opened the door and said Bastards she said to them to the guerrillas Bastards she said to them because of you we're going to die too through no fault of our own she sai
She closed the door and Ines said to me What are we going to do with Luis Alonso Now we now we didn't we didn't pay attention to the kids we had forgotten about the kids we were going to attend to my brothe
But car was coming by with white flag that meant peace and in that car there was friend of Luis Alonso's and also guerrilla came in that ca
And so they came in through the interior door there they turned like this and came in through the door and and they knocke
Because well no Ines was putting up an argument that when he told her No he said e Luis Alonso I may be going to die he said because so much blood loss he sai
No he said I'm going to take you to such guerrillas' doctor and they took him awa
They took out all the rest of the shrapnel but the one in his eyebrow they couldn't get it ou
So they tool him away we didn't see him anymore they took him to San Miguel don't know if in that vehicle surely in the same car they were riding in they took him to the hospita
Then we were left and since they were still in front of the house we went to woman's home who was nurse so when big round of gunfire started we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses we walked little way we threw ourselves against the other wall until we could get ther
And when we got there the woman said Go on in to the main house and another house father insid
And there was wounded wounded woman by by bullet too that they had brought since she was nurse and there we wer
And then well we found out that my brother had been admitted until they took out th that fragment0 they let him come but now he didn't come he went to to the department of education and asked transfer they didn't deny it to him they transferred him to another place immediatel
Then now well like told you there were plenty of times that that we had encounters like tha
There in in another part of Tejutla they also killed brotherinlaw of mine my sister's husband because the guerrillas also came in in the nigh
They had big firefight like that and there was my bro er my brotherinlaw was he also die
That's the way way it was they're big plenty if were to tell you all the stories of what we went through tell you that I'd keep you all night That's how it was it was said but thank God in the family hardly The guerrillas also took out man from the outskirts near the the place where we lived who was called Jua
He was like catequist one of those people who helps the priests and according to the guerrillas they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army mean he started to say where they were so that the soldiers would go directly to where they were and one day they guerrillas took him out and killed hi
And what else do you want me to tell you If you want to keep on that's fine but so much time Don't be nervou
And how was growing up in Charlotte Did you like it or Yeah liked it lo
If you're not from Charlotte you're not going to know where that's at but um it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like tha
And um my junior year of high sch high school we moved into like the city the west side of Charlotte and went to West Meck and that was a um culture experience  guess
Like in most schools in Charlotte if you go on other sides it's like everybody's just white but in my school there was every kind of person you could ever mee
Do you think that's good thing that it helped culture you or Yeah it did because know people from Charlotte now that went to like not to slam Providence because like lot of those people but they like have like so many like stereotypes of people because they don't know anybod
And so is there anything in particular about growing up that you want to share that maybe changed you as person Or made you the person that you are Anything in particular Hm
mean like my junior year of high school the first dress ever owned was my junior year prom dress Like because my dad always treated me like boy because was like was the first girl on my dad's side of the family in like four generations or something like tha
Like my greatgrandfather's brothers and dadadada and then my dad had one brother and my two older cousins were both guy
And then there was never like any female blood Averetts until like my oldest cousin had kid
But like so was always raised like tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like guy all the tim
Like when lived at home we did not get along at all for anything in the world; we would fight all the tim
Cause we're like now can say this because I'm older or whatever and can like deal with it I'm exactly like my da
But when was younger would have shot myself before would have admitted that me and my dad were the exact same So you guys get along really well now Yea
Unless I'm like when go home for like Christmas break after being there for like two weeks it was like I'd never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each othe
know about that Now what about your mom Were you close with her when you were growing up was closer with my dad when was little just because did all the sports and everything like that and I've always been close to my mom it was never like didn't like my mom but um me my mom and never really fight or anything like that but now me and my mom are lot close
When started doing like the whole shopping thing the makeup thing everything like that me and my mom got really really clos
And then like now that I'm in college like call her like all the time and it won't occur that should talk to my dad too But then like me and my mom will talk all the time and she'll come over here and she'll like have beer and cigarette with me and it doesn't matter anymore Just because you know she knows how am gues
Do you think that's hard for your dad maybe that you're closer with your mom now than you are your dad Or do you think he kind of understands that's just the way Um it was hard for him at first think because um like all of sudden was like so into softball so into sports and everything like that and I'm still like I'm still like tha
Do you think he resents that now or don't think he resents it think he kind of had to suck it up and get it over with get over i
Because like he saw that like think he saw that was like him before would admit that was like hi
Because he knew that was going to do what wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because was still like not going to run out in rampage and kind and be like horrible person but it was just like my life now and And what's your major Theate
Actually my first semester at Charlotte was PreBusiness major to go into Marketing and Advertising because did that in high school to
And cause was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like tha
And kind of like coming in to college or whatever he kind of convinced me that what else am going to do Uhhu
If I he's like You're not going to do anything dadada He wasn't real supportive about it at al
But um after my first semester was over with and had like real Theater class knew that's what still wanted to d
Oh gosh Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said Major THEA and she was like What is this She knew was going to do it but Dad was pretty irat
That was the deal for them to get off my back and let me do what wanted to d
Well actually when went the whole first year the whole first semester because worked at the pool on campus for yea
Because I'm like lifeguard every summer and this year had to get winter job all yea
And it's hard to go from having like your whole day to go to classes and do whatever you want to do and space out everything then like having to like drive across town and go to wor
That's probably why I'm theater major so can kind of you know do what plays want and then move o
Do you think they've become more ex do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's going to take while Or if they ever will at all Um my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when went home don't even remember why went home but went home for something and he's like he's still trying to convince me to double majo
And I'm like I'm trying to convince him to you know if don't make it and there's strong possibility won't know that I'm not stupid I'm nor going to go to L
And do all that and mean if don't make it my life's not going to be over or something like can't go back to schoo
My dad he don't know he doesn't think I'm stupid but he doesn't he wants better for me than what he ha
He thinks you know it's just kind of that whole thing he wants me to get everything now because he thinks once you're his age it's too lat
He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do i
What does he do What does he do for living He's brick mason which he builds like building
Like neither like I'm the first one in my family to go to college on my dad's sid
That's why it's such like big thing because my uncle he went he went into the military and then came ou
And like my cousins like one of my cousins he's just like slack; he dropped out of high school his senior yea
don't kind of don't think about that though because I'm like my life is my life you know And like my family's big part of i
It kind of gets tiring and that's what don't like you know don't like to talk about myself when go around my famil
You know they're all like Oh good Dadadadada I'm like Do they praise you lot Yea
And you don't like that love it do but it gets to point where like feel like if fail it's just going to be like way too much for everybod
I'm the only girl you know besides my cousin's kids who are like two and thre
So nobody knows what they're going to be yet and considering Chris is raising them that doesn't you know say too much for them two little girl
I'm making my family sound really bad but they're really not that bad No Everybody's family is differen
She waits tables like one night week at another job to help put me through and everything like tha
So What do you do Where where are you working now Now I'm starting my whole lifeguard thing this summe
I'm opening up like five pools and they're giving me headache because they all turned green today so that's like the most fun job for m
big responsibility Yeah but I've done it for so long I'm used to like lifeguard and like everything like tha
Last year managed one pool and the other pools are kind of small and like few of our sisters are working for m
Like mean if let's say make it really big you know big famous person or whatever I'll live her
And then I'll go and everything like that when I'm big enough to make my decisions on when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuf
You can't go into it and be like Oh I'm going to be big movie star one day and everything like that because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowher
You know like know one day I'll have to sit down and decide if I'm where want to be in life or if I'm no
That's good attitude Well definitely think you're going to do something with it and want to thank you for talking to u
Um don't think I'll be able to settle down here though because most of my relatives live up nort
So when graduate more than likely I'll move to Boston but Charlotte has definitely been nice place to liv
I've never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that and there's always been something for me to do like in high school or in college there's always things to go do so it's been nice place to grow u
Do you think it will be strange to move up north when you've lived in Charlotte all your life Do you think there'll be very big culture shock don't know that it will be very big culture shock because I've grown up going to Boston all the tim
It won't be too different but the style of the city is little different so Umhm
Do you feel that Charlotte has changed lot since you were growing up here Do feel like it's changed lot It's definitely grow
If you want to move so bad why did you go to school here Uh the reason choose to go to school here is because my parents live around 30 minutes away and wanted to be away from home yet be able to go home if needed to so Uhhu
Don't you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there not seeing them as much Or do you feel you're ready for the change Um I'll definitely be ready for the chang
I've been going up as progress in school so I it will be good change for m
So you'll stay here for the four years and then move or would you transfer schools Um if was able to get educational opportunities in school would transfer but I'm happy with school here with my sorority with the city with mean I'm happy with the way things are right now so probably when graduat
And what is it you want to do when you graduate would like to look for job in education possibly teaching elementary school um hopefully up north would rather do that up north so How come For any particular reason mean just mostly because my family lives up there and enjoy being up ther
It won't bother you the cold weather and stuff can say that because I'm from ther
That won't bother you It would definitely be an adjustment but I've been up there with the weather before and um I'm not it's not hard for me to adjust to things so Do you like the weather in Charlotte Do you enjoy Oh definitely like the weather in Charlotte so that would be kind of shock for me to have those winters but I'll be able to adjust to i
How was it going to high school in Charlotte Do you feel like do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north guess actually it would because in high school was on State cheerleading championship squad and they don't have squads like that up north as much my cousins tell me from their high schoo
Do you feel like that's Southern thing or NC thing or Well actually kind of having guys on cheerleading squad in high school is more Southern thing because my cousins in Boston had never heard of that before me so Uhhu
So you feel like it's southern thing Because in NY where I'm from they do not cheerleading and that stuff isn't as big as it is down her
Well that was big part for me in high school so definitely think it would have made difference it had lived up there for high schoo
So was an important part of being in high school Oh That was my life It truly was my life in high schoo
And it was an important aspect was there particular crowd that hung out because of that Oh ye
It was the little popular crowd you know the little we're better than everybody else crow
hate to say that but it is true What about the people that didn't do that mean wasn't particular snobby one but there were some that were so So it was the cheerleaders dated the football players Yea
It was And do you feel like it was good thing to grow up around N
Just because they don't have as much money as you or they don't do the same things as you do doesn't mean they're not good person insid
The money aspect is that in your high school did that affect stuff how person fit in or It really did because lot of the people on my group their friends were well of
They had awesome cars and they strutted around with their awesome clothes and the other people who didn't really didn't hang out with our group of friend
Does that make for lot of pressure to have lot of money It does Because my family is by no means rich but we never had that much trouble s
You want to be down anymore than anybody else so Is there anything else you wanted to talk about High school or college guess want to say that it's been real positive experience living here because my my mother really wants to move back up north because that's where she's fro
But my father loves the South so guess it would be an adjustment for him if they moved s
UNCC is good school it's probably the right size wouldn't want to go to bigger school s
If you could state your name and your um date of birth your age and where you were born and where just basically just brief sketch of all the places you've lived real quickly if you ca
There resided until 1970 um '70 or one when we moved to northeastern PA more specifically little squirt of town called Laceyville and there lived until was seven 16 in 1985 and moved here to Belmont N
And how OK can you tell me any flood stories about growing up in Penn Oh we lived uh not far from the Susquehanna River where our church was down that way Skinners Eddy United Methodist Church specifically and don't know if it was in the year that the king died there in '77 or if it was '78 but flood came and course the kids were all you know told to leave school parents would come get you the buses ran special routes and so fort
remember going down to the church and there was group of men there that were organizing an uh evacuation of all the valuables of the church take them to the second floo
We had large tractortrailer parked out front and uh these guys all assembled to take the pews out of the churc
I'm maybe I'm maybe nine 10 years old and uh of all these adults assembled there not one of them had pair of pliers or wrenc
fortunately remembered when Mom and left to go to the church to bring wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floo
This as young child kind of stunned me you know that we're going to go evacuate pews from church and we're not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of ther
Yeah um how about because know weather always reeked uh certainly during the wintertime and all of the snowstorms that would come u
 One of my favorite one of my favorite stories is the one about with you and my brother Ryan the one day that you went sleddin
Sleigh riding down uh property line that divided our house our land from another neighbor that was kind of a swell or ditch if you will there and that would freeze the water would freeze in that so you basically had uh like luge is that what it is Uhhu
Ice with little bit of snow on top of it and we were in little toboggan sled there not the not the kind roll up there like plastic sheet but boat sle
And uh we we were moving pretty quickly down through there and happened to glance up the road and there was car comin
So have my sister's kid here and I'm going to kill him underneath this vehicle shortl
So we uh through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on big knot of ice but uh don't think Marsha knew about that until few years ago guess don't know it's been while but uh yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the leas
remember many mornings walking down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freez
It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and you'd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be solid sheet of ice you'd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh had couple of deviant children there on the bus and one's name was Robbie Shar
He would pick chewing gum up off the floor and chew it disgusting things he was deviant little sucke
And uh don't remember the specifics as to what he did but the bus driver Louie was about four and half feet tall driving 72passenger diesel bu
Uh he would he would try to straighten out Robbie so he would call Robbie up to the front of the bus and he'd tell him Boy want you to sit there on that top step don't say sound don't make sound don't move don't want to even know you're there And every stop we make now you got to remember when those bus doors open what little heat that's in that bus goes out that door and the cold comes i
Every time we stop want you to get off and let whoever I'm letting on in and then you get back in sit on the step All the way through that hour and 15 minute bus route old Robbie get off he'd stand outside the bus let the kids on and he'd get back i
And then snow ice uh can remember me and another boy once we got about sixth or seventh grade we'd stop uh you couldn't run with chains on your bus on state maintained highway
You can do that on your on your county roads and think they call them borough if remember right up that wa
Um you could run with chains on those secondary roads um but once you got on state road you couldn't so it would be point in our bus route that we would have to get out and it would be you know don't know 20 25 degrees wind blowing and we'd help Louie get the chains off the bu
That was you know you kind of felt important at that point because you've you've graduated to next level of adolescence you're now helping the bus drive
And uh the elementary school as you got to the high school of course that was different than it is down here our elementary school only ran until sixth grade and we went to the high school building at seventh grade so you had seven through 12 all in one big buildin
But once you got to that point you still stopped at the elementary school and we would help those kids get off the bus we would have emergency drills and that sort of thin
We had one spot on our route at the top of Browntown Mountain which was about two mile drag downhill which you know could be deadly for large trucks or cars on ice in any situatio
can remember sitting there and Louie saying Everybody be quiet shutup It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highwa
We would all slide the windows down on the bus open the door stick your head out the door you couldn't hear anything coming that way you couldn't hear anything coming the other way and he'd just drop it in low and gun it we would make it another mornin
That seems like that was two or three weeks out of the school year in the spring especially that the fog would just be outrageou
can remember it being so cold again that uh one circumstance coming from uh Springhill where live down into town which was Laceyville the bus wouldn't run it kept cutting off it was diese
It was so cold that the fuel does what they call congeals the fuel becomes like gelati
We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would ru
That was uh that was the most exciting part of you know most important most exciting part of going to school was getting there for m
How about um your motorcycle Um yes y'all need to include that picture with my little dysentery here uh disinter guess it i
guess it was 1979 my dad bought me little Yamaha 80 motorcycle could cruise through the fields and dirt roads and so forth which uh had real good luck with that guess up until um don't know what year that was ther
Groundhog hole found the front tire of the motorcycle and managed to fly over the handlebar
don't remember but only only fractured collarbone which recommend to anyone that needs to break bone break collarbon
Our neighbor had pool and we were kind of like the Hatfield's and McCoy's they weren't very nice people and they didn't like u
Well we found out couple of days later when the neighbor walked over and informed my dad that he found BB in the filter pump of his swimming poo
We lived in uh in dairy land country and uh little things you missed which now don't know if like or no
We had barn dairy farm that was maybe quarter of mile from the house and uh Mama say We need milk Well the town was three miles away and the barn was 1000 feet so you grab your little stainless steel kettle with lid on it and handl
You'd walk down the road with dollar bill in your hand now this is in the midseventies but still milk was twice that in the store gues
You'd go down to this big stainless steel vat that was would hold thousand gallons of milk then you'll pull the lid of this vat and lower you're kettle down in to i
Ice cold milk and uh pull it out of course it was whole milk and cream on to
You couldn't leave it if you didn't rinse your glass out after you got drinking after you got done drinking it would stick to the glass to the point where you'd have to scrape i
Um what other now know you worked with your dad in the beginning there when you were quite younge
We were putting siding on her house and beat on the door nobody comes to the door it's summertime everybody sleeping until 100
got to get the windows open in order to pin bend the metal around them and so forth this girl and had always had love hate relationship on the bus love to hate he
And uh me and my friend there we'd always sit together in the first or second seat on the bu
Well when she we would pick her up on the route she'd want to sit with u
It was the closest seat she was only on the bus few minutes and then we were dumping the elementary kids and we had plenty of room agai
So she we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning putting siding dad and are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the doo
The door was unlocked and had to get the windows open so just kind of go cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the windo
Well that window happened to be through her room so just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and said Good morning and she just screame
Do you remember the first jobs that you that you did um because I did you don't think you started working with your dad did you You got job cutting siding wasn't it Well that was for Da
He was paying him five bucks an hour and he would he could work all day Wednesday and uh but believe it was on that job there that Kavalo that Dad said Look boy you can read tape measure better that this forty year old man can so I'll give you five bucks an hour if you prove you can do it Excuse m
So after two or three days he called Callgrove and said Don't bother coming in found guy better than you Well when Callgrove found out it was me that that kind of hurt his feelings little you know but ever since then Pop and worked all summers every summer we did the Kavalo job then we built barn the following year for the Reamuses down on the rive
fell off that roof there's little miracle missed boulder by about six inches which would have probably shattered my spine when fell off that but you get you're lucky everybody's here for reason just what condition you're in when you're still her
Do you remember didn't oh I when was kid don't even remember that son only heard about i
Do you remember any stories or do you have any stories about your grandparents Uh not so much stories about Grandmom and Grandpop um Because they were living in a in an apartment basicall
went and stayed with Grandmom and Grandpop Borel in their little two bed one bedroom apartment in NJ and uh guess stayed five or six day
Grandpop was very quiet somber man he wouldn't say much but uh Gra ndmom was little more boisterou
They had small poodle named Fifi it was disgusting but learned uh you know how you learn respect for for people in in different ways um for you know for all Grandpop didn't say much Grandpop had more love and affection for that dog and showed it to that dog probably more than most parents show to their kids toda
mean man had hip replacements and bad knees and everything else and he'd get on his knees and play with that dog and give it it's medicine put peanut butter on his finger and feed it to that dog to keep that dog aliv
Um know lot of people wouldn't couldn't mean and for him he wouldn't have bent down to pick up quarter because it would have hurt him too muc
She uh she'd had laryngitis and the doctor told her if you don't quit smoking you'll never tal
She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you don't quit smoking you're going to lose your foo
And that time spent with them was the coolest because grandmom would let me smoke and at 12 13 years old you know being able to sit there and smoke cigarettes with grandm
Now that was uh man the most flavorful cigarette I'd ever smoked course at 12 what did you ever smoke you know But uh come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running the smoke hung about four and half five feet down from the ceilin
mean literally you could just see it hang it looked like fire scene on the news it was awfu
mean you have smoked potatoes and smoked roast beef smoked sandwiches smoked syrup everything tasted like smok
And clothes everything just reeked of it especially if you went outside for 15 minutes and actually got huh fresh smo
And then came back in oh my gosh the second hand smoke in there was enough to kill uh farm full of peopl
Well think what was worse about their place is not only the smoke hanging in the air but they kept it at  80 degree
 Even in the in mean NJ winters are really cold but And Grandpop would complain that it was still cold in ther
Do you remember any stories about Grandma Mackton your mom's little bit The only stories remember about Grandmom Mackton would be uh when uh Grandpop Mackton uh he was watch repairman and so forth and this was even actually before my time remember this just being translated to me from my dad um my sisters Marsha and Rayona would be over there visiting with my mom and dad and Grandpop would be working on watch and he'd drop par
Now you can picture the part out of watch how small this is and for guy that in his probably sixties at that point difficult for him to see lighting in that day and time not being what it is now of course he'd lose his part and he'd say Tootles well first he'd have his fit Nothing but damn junk junk junk He'd say about these watches he was fixing Nothing but bunch of GD junk can remember Mom and Dad saying Grandmom in the kitchen hollering Daddy Daddy Daddy wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of the girls Then Grandpop he'd calm down Tootles you see this part her
Can you find one just like it for Grandpa And he they would get down there and they'd find it and find it for hi
remember too Dad say that Grandmom would fuss at him for giving the girls money say don't remember now how much it was but if pack of cigarettes was 15 cents he'd give the girls quarte
Now this is going back to the fifties and early sixties when you could still do that but he'd send these young girls 10 or 11 years old maybe down to the general store and get him pack of cigarettes well with the change they could buy licorice and candy and what no
Daddy Daddy Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes Well they get candy Mom You know that's how he justified it they were getting something out of i
How about do remember any stories that that you've been told by your by your sisters about them growing up or have they told stories about you growing up that you can remember Well some of them that uh with your mother Marsha uh she was believe about 18 when was bor
And uh everyone you know going out to eat or anything like that then uh the waiter would say to my parents What would you like what would you like and then they ask my sister what would she like for my so
My sister had uh an apartment in NJ and remember there was she had roommate young girl which hindsight is 2020 she used to say she was going to kidnap in the middle of the night put me in bed with he
would just scream and scream you know that No no don't do that But stories remember hearing one of uh believe it was Marsha uh the wind caught the storm door there she was she was uh hanging on to the back storm door and guess pulled it open little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yar
We were helping my niece and nephew paint new house that they bought and uh he uh little Raymond was with u
He said Daddy have to go poopoo And said Well son the Portojohn is way down there in the neighborhoo
Tell me when you feel it peeping out and then we'll run like hell And my one sister Rayona she reminds me of that story and laughs every time we tell i
can well you know we just relived the story today of when you built the house over on um  Songbir
And those moments of idiotic stupidity we uh we put some scaffolding out on the front of the house and uh just shot twobyfour out the side of the house with couple of nails in it and got out there and climbed on top of i
One story does come to my mind though where you painted the foundation coating on the house and got tar all over yo
And you said How do get this tar off of me uncle said Well you can use paint thinner or turpentine or gasoline Well what do you have said Well we got some  gasoline   Gasolin
No it was gas because you washed your legs all over because you did it in short
Grandpop's drowning mean everything on him is soaking wet and Ryan's got on long honest to God he had on long sleeve shirt with the collar buttoned u
Yeah know he had on pants he had on long sleeve think the cuffs were rolled up once or twic
How about the day that um how about the day that would to help you with the two by six'
Rafters out on the back porch and went to reach board to hand it you and another board slippe
think we hid it from her didn't we Yeah you didn't tell her too much about it until later that you smashed your foot up pretty ba
You had put some type of beam between the two floor joists and you went to hit it with hammer and you were hitting it backwards and it smacked it into your ches
Had my head up between ceiling joists nailing rafters glanced off the rafter and hit myself in the head with hamme
How about um how about this story of Grandpop and his son of your dad Oh yea
That was when we first moved here to NC we uh had job across the street from where we build him house uh Truman hous
And uh we were borrowing guy's saw chop saw miter saw and um upstairs nailing down trim and hear the saw every once in while so know he's down there working and all of sudden don't hear the saw and run out of new tri
He said that saw drifted down and hit him right across the back of his thum
Yeah so he's kind of standing there at the kitchen sink and my mom's running around like chicken with her head cut of
BandAids are at the kitchen sink the peroxide is in the basement you know the gauze is in the bathroom and the tape for that is upstair
Oh lord she's running around carrying on well Dad makes the mistake of looking at his wound and his knees go out from under hi
think uhoh 200 pounds of mush going to be laying on the floor I'll never get him up you kno
So we quick think and go well grab paper towel and wet it and throw couple of ice cubes in and put it on his hand get him up to his feet and haul him off to the emergency roo
He's trooper that way he that doesn't make any difference as far as him being hurt he'll wor
remember um one of the best trips we had which was why we've since created the Borel Family Reunion was funeral we had funeral for my grandfather Grandpop Bore
believe it was Dodge wasn't it If my father bought it it would have to be Dodg
 Chevy conversion van at 70 miles an hour would make the freakiest noises which would wake my sister up to prompt her to poke me and tell to slow dow
 Of course we had to do it in day because we couldn't take enough time everybod
It's very attractive billboard but it was not anything franchised where you could actually say Oh yes know that So we took chance on it and started following the billboard
swear to God it must have been 17 miles later like on three secondary roads down dirt road at the end of trail was this nice kind of western looking restaurant that we ended up eating a
But it kind of killed an hour out of our trip as far as time but we had lot of fun at that uh that funera
had cousin there that had a he was guess in his twenties and uh he loaded the trunk of his car with beer and after the funeral we all kind of stood out in the parking lot drinking beer smoking cigarettes and it wasn't um until after Grandmom died and uh we were sitting at uh cousin's house sitting in his basement and um his name was Raymond Ward and he was kind of hosting the post funeral procession there that goes o
And said to some of my cousins that had only the last had seen was at Grandpop's funera
said You know this really sucks we all have really good time and it's really sad occasio
Why don't we do this in spite of not don't have funeral let's just get together And we were just sitting there and the majority of the family at that point lived in PA and the rest of it lived here in NC and sitting there with him we just kind of said You know we ought to find place in the middle And uh my parents and had stopped many times in little town called New Market VA which was just  little  yeah it seemed like halfway poin
Turns out it was 226 miles to New Market from PA and 320 miles from NC to New Marke
And now we can sit around drink beer by the pool smoke cigarettes and tell stories without somebody dyin
But know ironically don't think why in fact know we had one reunion and then we lost family member that Raymond Ward that we met at his hous
Any more interesting stories you know that tell was just well always thought the one with um about Aunt Ann and the bir

The first stories that you remember um stories that were read to you or told to you and who told the
What what are some of the first stories you remember Um the one that really sticks out lot is uh before my parents had TV their want to say it's their aunts and uncles who lived mile up the dirt road had the first TV in the whole family and so after all the farm work was taken care of and everybody had dinner and that evening everybody would walk up the dirt roa
And in between the houses you had this pasture where they kept the cows and bull
And on this particular night it was night they they had bull out there that was pretty mean and would charge the fence at peopl
And uh they were walking up the path and Grandma accidentally stepped in something that was really soft and her foot got to sinking and instead of her pulling that one foot back out and shaking it off to keep going she stuck both feet in there and she started to holle
And they said somehow someway Grandma was with them when they got to the aunts and uncles hous
So but uh mom would always sit us around at home at the evenings um and tell us about her days growing u
They walking to school in the rain sleet and snow five miles and all this other crazy stuff Uphill both way
And how they use to take their lunches to school and some of the things they took for lunch like fatback meat biscuits an
Where is where was this Where did they grow up They grew up in Lewisburg NC which is little small town it's east of Raleig
On farm and uh she has some wild and crazy stories that she sat and shared with u
And um they talked about how quarter could buy them so much candy cookies drinks and that stuff and talked about some of the things wild things that went on on the farm some of the ghost stories the hankses they called the
These are dead people that are I at that time I she just called them hank
He never did see the head of it before he took off running so and uh something that jumped on the back of the horse
You know at that time was like you panther here in North Carolina So jumped on one of the horses bac
Now where did you when you were hearing these stories your mother was telling them to you where were you living at the time We were staying here in Albemarl
We moved from down there up here at very young age and we don't remember lot about the old as they call it their hom
But uh we hear lot about home and how it used to be and like said walking five miles to school and So don't complain Elber
Well can remember as small child probably between the ages of three and seven going to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when was fairly young so mostly remember visiting my grandmothe
The uh neighborhood she lived in was very uh quiet mostly older people and uh we used to go around the neighborhood and visit lot of her old friend
Um one couple in particular the Blankenships had apple tree in their back yard and we would go and we would pick apples and take them back to her place and make apple pie
The Blankenships were kind of an odd couple in that uh both of them chewed tobacco and spit into little spittoon
Uh it's kind of weird talking to an elderly couple spitting tobacco especially because one of them was female and you always had that impression that chewing tobacco was guy thin
She had washing machine but not not dryer so all the laundry get got put hung out on the clotheslin
Uh she had big garage that was separate from the house and almost bigger than the house it was almost like it was bar
And bunch of my grandfather's old tools were in there odd things like like scythes and things that you would find only on farm even though the house itself was not on farmlan
Uh my grandmother had 64 Nova which most people would consider to be muscle car but uh she only drove it maybe two to three miles at the most and it usually took the whole day to plan what would happen if she were to need to drive somewhere so this car had very little mileage on it even though it was at that point about 20 years ol
Uh we used to sit on her back porch and uh snap uh beans or what they called doing snap beans uh which was really just taking green beans and snapping them into smaller piece
Uh we used to walk up to the local grocery store uh which was about three or four blocks awa
There was also candy store about three or four blocks in the other direction called Pud's that we used to walk up to and across the street from Pud's was the local fire department and the uh the firemen used to let us play on the fire engines which is completely unheard of nowadays but they let us you know climb all over them get inside and honk the horns you know put on fire jacket and boots or whatever we wanted to do and uh guess there just weren't lot of fires in Asheville in that part of town because they never seemed to be concerned that we would be interfering with their preparednes
Um don't know those are the the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Ashevill
We went to Linville Caverns once and we went to Sliding Rock and Biltmore House and some of the other attractions that are up that way in the western part of the stat
Uh think we even went to Tweetsie Railroad couple of times so uh you know the sort of just wholesome down home kind of memories about visiting my grandmother before she got uh unable to take care of herself and she ended up moving in with u
You know but they're rather pleasant memories of childhood and certainly wouldn't trade them for anythin
specific story that she used to tell or Not any stories that she used to tel
And uh they were all very active very strong people and even though my grandmother was tiny little woman she was about 5'2 uh she was pretty strong for her size and rugged and sturdy and that uh even carried over into her later years when mentally she wasn't all there but physically she was still extremely healthy and it was uh kind of strange kind of position to be i
Um guess the thing remember most about my grandmother's personality is that she was extremely fruga
guess there was one particular program where you would returned so many soup labels and they gave you rebate or something on collecting aluminum can
And uh she had just cartons and cartons of soup labels that she had saved over the years and redeem them you know don't know five cents bushel so she was very practical in that regar
Um she always kept all her bills and expenses at an absolute minimum ran everything very efficiently kept an extremely tidy house u
Is there anything your parents ever told you about her stories that they ever did like when they were kids Um guess when your father was ki
He spent most of his time with my grandfather learning things like how to work on cars and how to build things paint things and that translates over cause my dad does just about everything; he can fix about anything and build just about anything and repair just about anythin
Um guess the only story that they ever say lot about my grandmother was the fact that she did not like my mom when uh my father and she first got togethe
And uh mostly because my dad my dad's side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina my mom was Catholic from California which oh just scared everybody right ther
So before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this this evil heathen creature that was going to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her nasty letter to that effec
Um she pretty much showed lot of disinterest at best and and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came alon
Um once uh she had grandchildren my grandmother was all smiles to everybody which think was kind of amusin
Um guess at that point she figured it was too late so she might as well make the best of the situatio
What about when your grandma moved into the house with you were there any stories about her once she moved into the house Anything you remember Um not really anything unusua
Um she uh at that point things were she wasn't in the best of health so there weren't really any any unusual anecdotes that weren't immediately or at least tangentially related to her health and the decline of her health so no no interesting anecdotes about her personality or really or really anything that could talk about at that poin
had dream once of becoming musician most specifically probably producer slash rapperwriter extraordinaire in the music business and all of my hopes and dreams were shattered once actually got involved in the music industr
Um specifically guess more the recording aspect and dealing with the people that you have to deal with in the music industry on daytoday basis in that supposedly creative environment and um where to begin Let's see started in the music industry when was very young um as DJ and How old were you  My mother thought  how old was I was probably 12 or 13 years ol
My and somehow managed to convince my my mother and stepfather of the time to uh get me couple of turn tables and started mixing songs and scratching and doing all that D
And uh as continued got more into actually making the music that people would guess rap over and from there hooked up with few different people that were rappers if you will and and uh kind of developed my own interests in actually writing words and that sort thin
And this is guess after after high school kind of right before college actually while was in college before went away to school while was still in Brookly
And so was working with few people anyway um went away to school and got more into it and managed to do little business deal with few friends of mine that enabled me to get some equipment to actually produce music on more professional leve
And anyway uh anyway went on from there started doing lot of stuff in college working with um one person specificall
Anyways where was from that interruption Was working with somebody in college and um kid by the name of Phil and uh you know we put few demo tapes together and that kind thin
But really what we were the subject matter and content probably was bit far into the hiphop audienc
Um it seemed like we were more interested in kind of promoting level of consciousness and most other people were interested in talking shit about gang banging you know the whole gangster rap thing and that got really bi
So anyway so we uh got some response and and kind of adjusted things but after uh after while we kind of went our separate way
I uh went off to do my thing and he went off to to some other things and uh anyway um to make long story fairly short got married and being married gave me little bit of freedom as far as what need to do to make money because my wife was working and making enough to support u
So was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and unfortunately one aspect of the recording industry when you get started lot of times you have to do either very lowpaying or nonpaying internships to get into the recording studi
Specifically mean if you want to work at work at one of these places they they uh generally have lot of free help so uh you're not going to make whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in full time schedule so you really can't work another jo
But at any rate had this this freedom and um the girl had come into my life to to go and pursue this dream so um started working at place called D&D Studios which was known for doing um lot of hip hop music kind of stuff similar to what was interested in and was hoping I'd be able to make some some connections at least maybe do little bit of networking there and uh met some pretty cool people did some really kind of really interesting projects um but What kinds of people Well let's see people that I've me
A DJ by the name of Funk Master Flex who put out few albums and don't even remember what they calle
The Mix Mix Tape Volume one and two and three to whatever it is now and guy by the name of D
Premier who worked with um Gangstar group called Gangstar and uh another guy named Jerry O'Danagar who also worked with guy named JayZ who's pretty popular right now um guy from out west named Exhibit and uh basically very kind of close knit group of people that did this professionally that that really mostly came from Brooklyn and few other areas of New York Cit
It was really dirty and had reputation as being such um kind of grungy atmosphere environment but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have yo
From there that was kind of frustrating me little bit going into um sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts drinking forties of Old English and really not getting whole lot of stuff done that was it was it was just depressin
And uh seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn't very encouraging or inspiring to m
Um so began looking around for other studios that thought might uh have higher level of professionalis
From there went to place called Battery Studios which had everything that that was looking fo
It was uh very established studio and had put out lot of um guess well known artists and it was actually it was affiliated with Jive Records um and Jive Records guess at the time had their big act was the Backstreet Boys and they were recording the Backstreet Boys' first American released albu
So got to work on that little bit um and actually met the whole the whole other caliber of artist
But then also lot of the same that uh that deal with the D&D and it was much cleaner environmen
They they definitely had lot of pride in in the appearance of the studio and how well it was maintained which was nic
It was nice to at least be working for people who seemed to care about where they were and how things were handle
And met some interesting people there and um D'Angelo was probably one of the most interesting people that met there and just just one of the most down to earth artists that I have met in the industr
He did things very slowly and don't think that wasn't necessarily the weed that he smoked think he just had style of working and that was how he did i
If if it's Things Fall Apart yeah my name is in the album binding as an assistant engineering credit on the creative cut trac
So what did you actually do helped people put their music and their vocals to tap
Basically um the engineer is pretty much the one that that mans the the mixing board and adjusts all the volume levels and equalizes the the different instruments and sounds and separates things and adds effects to it echoes and So do they actually change the tone of people's voice They can change the tone of people's voice ye
Do they do it lot They don't do it lot but with with artists um that really can't sing very well that are very big artists that they need to have perfect sound on the recording they d
think her first name was Patricia and don't really recall her last name but she was French artis
They were comparing her to the French Mariah Carey is actually what they described her as and I never heard of her before being there and haven't really heard anything of her since but remember they were doing an album of hers and everyday after they would do it they would give digital tape to different engineer who would then take it in the back room and correct her voic
Don't they do that lot with like Britney Spears and people like that Well with Brittney Spears think what they probably do is they um they've got lot of back up singers that can sing and they kind of blend her voice into theirs when she can't quite do i
And another another technique that they kind use is chorusing where they will allow you to basically record your vocal the same the same verse or the same whatever the same words the same lyrics on few different tracks and they'll kind blend it all together so that it it almost sounds like one very full voic
They also have lot of uh effects processors that they can run it through that will add harmonics that will kind of smooth out the voic
It just kind fills it out little bit makes it little easier on the ear especially if they can't sing bu
Well Battery Studios was great but it was just uh it was just hectic because once if if they actually liked you and they liked how you worked there and you got along well with the artists and the engineers and stuff like that they would work you to deat
Tiring Yeah mean it was kind it was rough especially on young marriage when when you go into work at six p
you know basically crossing paths on the way out as as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a
come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work go to sleep she goes to work wake up eat shower and all that good stuff and then uh she's coming home and I'm going out agai
We didn't get to spend any time with each other and just being married and you know within year or so or year or two it was um Kim being unfamiliar with with New York City and not really liking it very muc
It was kind of it's sort of it seemed unfair to me to um to subject her to that and plus mean the schedule was just starting to take toll on me as well and you can only put in so many 80 hour weeks before you kind of break down from i
Unfortunately um at least like with managers and producers and and other guess industry executives or industry people and other people that really could make decisions about things when they're in the studio working with somebody else that's what they focus o
Plus being there and watching how they dealt with other people you kind of pick on people's shadiness and and bullshit so that they just mean you kind of see people for what they are when they don't have their guard up as much and under those kind those conditions they really don't have their guard up that much they're just kind relaxing and being themselves and it's kind of scary to see what some people are when they're being themselve
But uh guess did that for it must have been close to um year and half maybe and then decided not and ended up leavin
think uh Fourth of July was my last day there in 1998 maybe '99 but it was fun while it lasted you know it was lot of cool experiences got to meet lot of interesting people um got exposed to what thought might want to do it and decided that didn't really want to do it so guess uh it was learning experience and one don't have any regrets about it but it was lot of fun and You can sto
What stories or books do you remember reading as child Was there favorite So that's two question

They had to grow everything they ate and they had nothing And of course her parents weren't one of these that had money in the bank that they actually lost anything anywa
But of course when all the surrounding the stores or whatever everybody had lost money and so the whole economy was totally poor whether they actually lost money or no
Um who is the best storyteller in your family The best storyteller in my family would have to say it would have been my Aunt Lizzy she's deceased now but Do you know why She can remember as child that in the it was like she was ageles

You know of course it's talking about being raptured and it's just such good follower of the Bibl

Uh think one of my favorite parts is when the two prophets you know they had the two You know Elijah and Moses are at the the Wailing Wall You know if you haven't read it don't want to tell you about it yet but oh mean it's it's just it's just wonderful You know it's it's just like when the Bible says it says that they will be there and nothin
mean if somebody threatens them or tries to harm them at all they're immediately consumed in uh in uh burst of fir
Well you know and then of course the Antichrist is trying to trying to say that well you know that they have machine guns hidden under their clothing and but they're they're absolutely wearing their tattered same tattered clothes that they would wear in the Bibl
And it talks about them having the long scruffy beards and they've been standing outside for days and days and days and months and um you know without bathing and without doing anythin
But mean it's you know God let's them all of sudden one day they have no protection and and they're kille
And then their bodies are put out in the streets and mean everything is just as an example Righ
But then you know they come back to life again and God takes them up to heave
Is there particular story you like from the Bible Hmmm like lot of them from the Bibl

Um could you tell us why Just the fourth man in the fire you know It's just cool to think that there's fourth man in ther
Absolutely OK well is there story that you could tell us like you know from your life now Something that isn't doesn't have to be you know relevan
mean my favorite in the jalapeno story but don't think we'll put that on tape [They both Laugh] Yea
Really For the whole world to know don't want them to know about the jalapeno stor
If somebody if somebody brings up topic it's like well I can do better than that You kno
Let me tell you this Umm well could tell you that you know my husband is always saying that he thinks I'm witch because can say something and then it happen
Uh we hadn't been married long and and we were driving down the road one da
saw box in the middle of the road you know and looked over at him and you know men always automatically you can just see them lining up like they're going to hit that you know Ye
And said Don't hit the box And he said Why said Well if it gets if it doesn't come out from under the car and it gets under the exhaust pipe and catch on fire And he's like Well that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life OK and didn't say another word and about two miles down the road of course you know it was fwapp fwapp fwapp' you know Yea
About two miles down the road he pulled over and said What are you doing He said I've got to get out and get that stupid bo
So to this day he'll about three weeks ago he called me and he said You'll never guess what happened to me now And said What He said I's driving down the road And he said I saw this bag in the road It wasn't even box and he said I thought That's weird And he said I couldn't it was like interstate and couldn't could not move over either wa
knew was going to run over it And he said I thought Now just wait and see if it does anythin
He um we were in CA and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to C
And was just fascinated with the big city San Francisco life so many cars and and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um the airport LA
And said and told him You know I've been here three days and as many police cars as I've seen said you know I've not seen single accident And he was like Oh don't say that don't say tha
We rent car and he decides he wants to take me to Hollywood drive down Rodeo Dr in Beverly Hills because he's been there befor
Bap And we get hit And he's like you know without saying Oh goodness you know Are you all right His head whips around and he says How's that Is that good enough accident for you And of course it was all my fault because could have said something about it earlie
Yeah um and there again I'm such sound sleeper that it was 430 in the morning and Tony woke me u
He was saying Debbie Debbie Wake up Wake up you know It's an earthquake I'm like You would say anything to wake me up you know And then I realized that he's on his knees and the whole building is shakin
And didn't know it at the time but we were on the fifteenth story of sixteenfloor buildin
And did not know it at the time but the hotel was built on sixfoot roller
Yeah but mean the the then that's another reason know now that everything is bolted to the wall
Everything you know Because you'd hear furniture crashing but can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power but we went straight to the window and it was just honestly think thought we were going to di
All right you could see transformers popping everywhere Just looking that's all you could see were light
And uh we immediately got on our knees and started praying buddy because knew we were goners Yeah woul
It didn't really it didn't really hit me but later on that day we were flying to San Francisc
Well our shuttle the hotel shuttle bus took us to the airport and on the way over there can remember he stayed on on his little CB thing the entire time with the dispatche
It was so foggy you couldn't see three feet in front of you no more that te
And she'd say well Don't go past such and such because the the bridge is out There were reports and and after got home I'd see film clips on TV where like policeman got kille
He was going across the bridge and you know it was so foggy he didn't know the bridge was out and it was just there you know and the entire surrounding area around us was like tha
Just all of sudden there would be sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just going down into it you know that didn't know that it was ther
So if it hadn't been for that guy and that radio we would never have made it to the airpor
But when we got to the airport we were the first flight that they let leave that day and we were sitting in the US Air club loung
And they were talking about armoires that were falling across their bed that weren't you know bolted Bolted bolted down and all of the sudden noticed that everybody we were just all sitting there just like like this right here like we were old people in room full of rocking chairs you know Oo
mean that was that was just aftershocks and tremors from the you know And thought What magnitude of power it would take to move the LAX airport Here we were all sitting there you kno
And you just just sitting there and you just get lightheaded and you just think Oh it's my equilibrium that's all messed up It was definitely an earthquak
In fact had called my mother and it's it's lucky called her as soon as did because later on the phones were down for hour
But called her and said Now mother just wanted to let you know that we're all right and she was like OK That's good And thought you know We're three hours behind them out there you kno
want you to know I'm fine And she's like Oh my God Measured ten on the Richter Scal
It's good thing that called her when did because later on when if she had heard about it on the news then she would have been terribly upse
We had to stay in hotel ratty hotel at that because there was no power n
There were lot of Duke Power people who lived down here so think that kind of helped us little bit but oh my worse kept putting off the laundry kept putting off the laundry and said I can't take it anymore Drove it to the laundromat and that day our power came back on You know and and coffe
couldn't get any coffee was dying for coffee That's all wanted was coffee But yeah when Hugo hit was at work that day and worked third shift at CocaCol
And there was only me and one other girl were the only two people in the whole buildin
Finally said Look you know we got to scrounge up the flashlight because you know there were no lights in the bathroom no anythin
So told her said Look we have the little area where we have all the supplies that little computer room Uhhu
And she said What if somebody drives by I'm like Well you know who do you expect to drive by in the hurricane In the storm That's righ
And thought No security patrol's going to be out here But uh you know my and and when got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper could see my va
parked right beside this great big tree and all that while worried about my van but not enough to where was going to go out there and move i
You know No And the whole time we were in there all you could hear was That's all you can hear Uhhu
And so every little bit would go and stick my head out the door and The van's OK Well of course worked twelve hour shift three days week or three nights week and that guess about seven o'clock was when the the when the next people were supposed to come i
He came and then he said Shh what happened to your van I'm like Nice try Richard but my van is fin
He said No man it's just awful I'm like Right Well went out there and looked and was like  You know The president of the company's room or uh office up on the top floor was on the end and don't know if you know where the CocaCola building is in Charlotte but it's kind of don't know like an oval and arc type shap
Well his office was like right here in the middle like right here on the end and the windows were blown out All these metal aluminum blinds were wrapped around the wheels of my van Oh my God piece of sheet rock don't know how large this sheet rock was but it had blown around the curve of the building like his office is here and mine was back her
For years every time I'd put my window down and come back up you would see little slivers little pieces of sheet rock on the side of my windo
mean it was awful And had pieces of it the driver's side door was all dented i
And and little later on didn't know it until later on that uh guess probably within year after the hurricane hit then you could start seeing little spots all over the side of the va
You know where it had just made little things that would How weird that didn't show up immediatel
Yeah Oh yeah it was like $160000 worth of damage to my van because of Hurricane Hug
And then when uh ended up staying at Coke like sixteen hours that day because you know the roads were shut down and nobody was coming i
Finally got to come down Tyvola; the new Tyvola above the Coliseum was pretty new at that tim
So just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and got out and started walking and was just can remember live wires being everywhere crackling and poppin
And the first thing saw when got home was my neighbor over here two houses ove
He was out and here come walking up and looking like something the cat drug i
And he's like Debbie Have you seen my shutters Every shutter on his house had blown away He was like All of sudden we were in KS And this was Dorothy It was like No Jerry haven't But it was it was really scary the just the scary mean I I it's weird it's like during the hurricane really felt safe in that building but driving home and all the trees that were dow
And when finally got here it's like you know just seeing everything and the house One of the first things noticed was when come up from the top of the hill was my house it looked like it had ivy growing all over i
Stuck on the Yeah mean it was just like moss or something grown on everybody's houses overnigh
And this house right here was just being built and parts of the roof had blown off if i
Everything that ever we had creek in the back of the house and whenever it stormed small storm or big storm it just floods come straight u
But now wasn't stupid or nothing when the lights were going shz shz' you know but she's Get under the bed in her bedroo
She's got one of those tall fourposter beds like that as going to save us but we had to get under there lot when was growing up bad storms Yea
No the Hickory Motor Inn To take shower I'll tell you what would have gone just to get cup of coffee That's about three more days of not taking shower Oh know Absolutely That's funny U
I'm trying to think um some stories that you told me that you know can be aired Without offending any members of the family That's right Which is the most important thing here I'm trying to think because you're always telling stories and just can't my mind is gone like your mind is gone on Saturda
So didn't hardly You don't remember anything do you And she would tell me lot of stories about him and you know The kind of person that he was Righ
Just real stories you know things that Like the first TV set you know when we used to have well water and the water had to be you know got out every afternoo
From stories that from her and from uh other family members mean everybody they would always say that that he would always be the first person to help yo
My mother always said that that he would help stranger you know get car out of ditch or whateve
And and it would take her three years to get him to do something for her around the hous
You know and like she say OK Mac you know You need to we've got hole in the roof and she would use that as an exampl
I'll get it fixed And then you know get up at three o'clock in the morning because somebody's called because somebody's in ditch or somethin
But uh actually kind of mean practical joker You got some of that then Yeah Absolutely And you help peopl
But um mean wouldn't take practical joke that far but there's nothing funnier than real good practical joke Yea
Do you have any That you can share Like my daddy he had five sisters and one of them was his favorit
mean they all say you know that she was his favorite and she was telling about when it was so hard for her to get to go on date because everybody was friend of my dadd
Forget his daddy They were afraid of my daddy And one of them said that one day he walked out to the car and they got where they wouldn't come to the house and she had to walk down this long driveway to pick her u
And she said my daddy come over there and she said He was so nice to my date And her date stayed in the ca
And said she said my daddy was leaning in over the passenger side like where she was sitting Uhhu
And she said He just kept talking to us and just telling us what good movie was playing and all this type thin
And he was so nice She said they didn't realize it until later on that evening that even while he stood there talking to him he had painted all up and down the side of this guy's car Oh my goodness That type thing you know That's That's what said don't destroy property you know And then the sister she just built house and you know back then mean uh she had uh she was probably one of the first ones in the family that own brick home you know Uhhu
And her and her husband had built new house and my daddy did lot of the carpentry wor
And the house once it was built and they got moved in she told everybody that as soon as they got in the house to take their shoes off well from what gather it really made my daddy mad because he had helped build it and you kno
So he went and got one of uncle's goats and took the goat back down there with him into the house You know just things like that mean I'm not malicious so My daddy well he didn't want Sherry and Billy riding in his car and he made them duck down in front of Billing's Store and when they got there he'd push them out of the ca
[They both laugh] Because he was so embarrassed But one time he ran over they went to down in Hickor
But they went to this snack bar one time that's the kind of place where everybody pulled in and they had the speakers Righ
And uh he ordered something and then he got out and he was cruising around acting cool and everythin
But he almost killed this guy He turned around the curve and this guy was holding the thing like this He was holding the drink he was holding was going shzzzz Sitting there holding See love stuff like that love stuff like that mean that's absolutely Of course he won't tell us anything because he won't tell us much of anything about his past because he had Mohawk and he just Yea
That's like you tell your stories to your children and it's like Who did you date when you were growing up I dated really nice guy
You know very cleancut Oh my God If they'd seen some of the guys used to date Oh really They were all scholars That's tru
And I'm afraid that all of them are going to be like him in the are
Does Sarah like to read like you do Who Sarah and Andy Do they they're are they kind of like Don They've slowed dow
They're were doing really good but Doing OK in school Absolutely think lot of it is that A
I'm all for AR but at the same time like right now had this little thing that kind of upsets m
On the AR It's hard for her to read at one it's hard for her to read two onepoint book
And if she reads onepoint book and takes test on it she misses question she gets pointnin
The reading another one point book she's going to get say she gets 100 on it she's still only got onepointnine and she had to have two point
So every week it seems like have to go to the library and get these little pointfive books as call them fillers just to fill i
And and and think to me I'm afraid that I'm taking away the joy of readin
But um think it's important because not all kids are athletes not all kids like athletic book
As much as like to read sports just isn't one of the things that held any interest for me whatsoeve
always liked books about true stories whether it was it could be murders you know those always grabbed my attention guess because knew it really happene
It's crying shame The whole thing you know could not get enough information about Alcatraz We got to meet one of the former inmates over there and one of the former guard
Actually bought one of his books but um mean it's just fascinating to me you know To be on the rock and jus
And the guard was the inmate was talking about he said you know he said They think that it's not we're not being punished enoug
Like when we got to go outside to the exercise yard He said But if you don't think that it's not punishmen
He said I promise you that could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area and he said If it was quiet enough you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together Your guess your imagination you know what all going on there you kno
would love would love to be able to stand right over there you know Just just to see oh This is wonderful Uhhu
would have liked to have been there when men were over there you know Machinegun Kelly an
Absolutely Well they had warden's houses all the officers all the guards; they all lived ther
There's no fresh water and no way of getting fresh water over there other than by boa
And so um of course everything that's over there you know how salt water damages you know Uhhu
And it was so cold and each prisoner was assigned little light almost like cardigan type sweater Yea
Here's the Golden you can stand right there and like pier you get under the Fisherman's Wharf and the pier's right there in San Francisco you can see Golden Gate Bridge Alcatraz there's Oakland Bridge Uhhu
If was on motorboat it would probably not take me five minutes to get over ther
It's beautiful and that's why it's called The Rock; it literally looks like big rock just popped out of the ocean and just you know water all the way around i
mean I'd like to go sometime but it's not on my Great ToDo list or anythin
We went to Big Bear Lake and we stayed at friend's house in um Alberta It's little town Albert It was little bitty town but it's ski country and um they'd just finished filming movi
We went panning for gold and went horseback riding down there and um um but when we went to see the trees the trees there was one tre
put the kids on it just so you could get an idea of about how large it wa
But this tree it's been years probably about six years or five years so don't remember the exact width or anything but this tree was so large and it was the first one that they had spotted so they cut it down and there wa
OK this is how big it was this tree that when the trunk part they holed it all out and made bowling alley out i
think like fourlane bowling alley Ooh fourlane bowling alley out of this tree God And right behind it the stump or whatever was leveled off and they made bar room with dance floor out of this tree mean it was so huge It was unreal Things like that mean that stuff fascinates me They had the trees where you could literally drive through the tre
The tree was kind of like sculpted out and big enough for you to drive through How neat I have pictures like started taking picture and make Tony and the girls stand like this with their arms you know and still have tree on both sides of them on either side of the
Just amazing These huge trees And that doesn't begin to tell you how tall they were just couldn't get over it It's just huge mean it's just huge That's coo
Was that your favorite vacation spot CA My favorite vacation spot That would be San Francisc
Oh God Just the bustle and the well everyday Tony would be working normally when we were ther
just couldn't wait for him to get up and go to work wherever he had to go that da
was hitting the Wharf you know mean just everything from the sights the sounds the smells the everything just loved it all The cable cars everything would stop on the Wharf and get some um prawns for lunch or something you know That's kind of cool It was just wonderful wouldn't want to live there But it was just absolutely wonderful Every time he goes back he has to go to San Francisco always try to g
But most of the time when I've been there it's been around January and it's not it doesn't seem like it's as cold as it is here but it's always foggy and January's pretty rainy to
But it's never so bad that it keeps me from doing anything you know mean can still walk all over the city and never remember having to walk with an umbrell
So but pretty often the day is kind of cloudy and just And you can shop lot Yea
Yeah and there's you know in CA it's unlike it is here they've got bread store
You know you go buy loaf of bread it's like loaf of bread stuck in one of the old paper popcorn holders you kno
mean it's not cellophane with twisttie There you go You know It's like loaf of bread that you can chew on while you're walking down the stree
You can literally just walk down the street you can get you bowl of clam chowder in the scooped out bread you know Oh yea
And mean just just things that you don't get here you know We have hot dog shop where they actually do that put soup in the bread but it's expensiv
Oh yeah Absolutely think that uh where were we Oh Disney World They have it there to
was trying to think the only other place I've seen it was Carowinds but no it was Disney Worl
And where they all come down and turn around it's like these people all have scheduled show times you know Like at one o'clock you have this Black guy down there they're playing fiddle and he'll play for 15 minutes it's time for the next cable car to come in and turn around and everybody's just gathered around ther
He passes his little hat around or his fiddle case or whatever and everybody throws money in i
Well then next time it's juggler and the next time it's mime and the next time it's three guys who play guitar
And you know it's just the culture and I'm always thinking you know it's not at least they're not expecting they are providing you some type of entertainment; they're doing something you kno
don't know what kind of dog it was but it couldn't have been more than foot tall standing on his little hind legs and he also had little hat and sunglasses and you could have your picture made with him for dolla
Things that you do not see every day It's almost like going to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little special little things you kno
All you have to do is open your eyes and you're there You have vendors that you know are selling homemade jewelry and there's still lot of the old hippies and you'd see lot of the old hippies to
That's my favorite CA would have to be my favorite vacation spot Sounds like the place to go You got to go want to go to CO for the Grand Canyon and all tha
There's lot in fact telling about San Francisco is my favorite spot that's my problem se
get to travel so infrequently that when do get to go I'm always thinking Well maybe I'd love to go do this and this and this And think Well what if go and don't have as much fun as would if had gone to you know Uhhu
So know if go here I'll have fun if go here So I'll go back there you know That's what tell Mar
mean it is so busy but if you want to be alone you can be alon
In one of the busiest cities in the world Absolutely And nobody cares And then you could walk down Navy Pier and it must be little bit like San Francisco only they don't have well they do have people down there making money but they're mostly drawing people and stuff like tha
It is beyond cool And nobody but you know people say they're indifferent or whatever but not really it's just that it's whole different lifestyle Exactly Absolutel
They don't don't their driving is my driving don't know but was getting screamed at and everything else but it's just different plac
Now like Schaumburg it's suburb and there's not you know it would be like being here you kno
You could go into the city for something special you know that was just there but everyday living you could just stay in Schaumburg and never to leav
When we stayed right there right in the heart of it could walk anywhere wanted to g
And we weren't could literally walk out of my hotel and then two blocks to Fisherman's Wharf and all the piers Pier 39 is my favorite it had hundreds of shops on it and you know and and these seals and nobody knows wh
And they've got all the little boat slips well they're just covered with seals all the time And nobody knows why they just started coming up there you kno
But it's just wonderful There's there's so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else but you can see it all just walking aroun
And still that's not that far but after walking up and down those hills You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night But it is absolutely wonderful There's shops there's um all kinds of like comedy clubs and stuf
And you can smell you have to love seafood you can smell seafood all over the city and hot breads and go get you bowl of chapino and big old thing of bread and just What's chapino It's like fisherman's ste
In fact bought got the recipe from the little where we went to eat at Fisherman's Whar
It's got like tomatobased soup and then it's got uh oysters it's got um crab claws it's got shrimp but nothing's peeled So you have to have these big bibs o
It's not something you'd want to eat on date you know Because it makes such mess But when we make it here at home but of course we peel everythin
Thank God When we make it at home we put like the whitefish in it and like uh uh tilapi
But it's just wonderful Wonderful think my favorite um food story from here is Tony putting pork rinds on the chicken Oh God Absolutely Atkins Diet Yeah Just crush up those pork rinds and roll your chicken in it It's much more creative really Yep That's when you get real desperat
Tony again somebody was asking me from church the other day he recently went to the men's breakfast the one they have once month on Saturday mornings And um Tony came back and said that he said I had to fix gravy for them And I'm like Uh oh He said What said I didn't know you knew how to cook But they've been asking me for long time And basically that's right they hav
But told them said Tony is one of those people who could improvise So have learned after 19 years of marriage have learned If you don't want to know don't ask Don't ask Because he won't lie to yo
If he tells you something it's the truth promise you he will not lie to you Like for instance one day there was little gravy stor
As sat down to eat it thought We don't have any milk And Tony likes powdered milk he grew up on that welfaretype mil
Yuck But anyway with clothespin on my nose was sitting there thinking and it was white gravy it was not water grav
So then got to thinking We don't have any powdered milk Yes we do said Tony look me straight in my eyes and tell me you did not put baby formula in this gravy And he looked at me and said How's it taste knew was eating baby formula gravy Eeeww So you know hey If hadn't have known would have been fine but knowing it's like Ooh was glad had quit nursing or he would have had breast milk in there There's some things you don't want to know Absolutely mean it's just like likeI've learned if you don't want to know don't ask him Because he can he can come up with stuff you wouldn't ever think about you know Was it OK Yeah mean it tasted fine but it was just knowing that it was in ther
Eating Enfamil gravy you know That's hilarious That's nasty too Absolute ly Uhhuh Whew Well Mark's told me about some of his creative stuff but Mark's pretty creative to
Like the time he cooked he left the Red vinegar Oh please Well Mark says stuff about it too and I'm like and I'm No we can't Forget it But no he um one time put he said I'm going to marinate these salmon steaks Neither one of us had had it in our whole married lif
Uhhuh that would be nice He's going to marinate it and cook it later you kno
It had oh God It was awful I'm not going to do that again On salmon steak kno
Oh golly I'd love to The only time we did it was when Bubba lived here because it's really expensive and we'll all go in together and make the ingredient
But uh it's and we even made our own little one day we all we always made you know got the bread machine and we always make big loaf of brea
Well bread's fine said You know said I would love to have some pasta So from that time on every time we'd fix it me and Bubba would fix big pot of angel hair past
It's got garlic and um I'm trying to remember what kind of peppers are in it but it is so good And you have to uh braise the little onions and stuff you kno
I've never had oysters but Even my kids will eat it Isn't that something too mean once you get to dipping out you you don't have to get an oyster you know Yea
One time she was sitting in the highchair she'd say That's no chicken And then an oyster bought her at the Fish Camp and she'd she'd bit into it and the centers are normally gray you know Yea
She'd bite it and OK just keep it You know Didn't faze her in the least Nate's eating um real food no
He had um well actually we tried those Gerber ones that have the whole peas and stuff like that little piece of chicken in the botto
And um he he actually ate like he'll eat baby food fruit or sometimes baby food cereal not you know not all the tim
You better watch it told Tony said you know Let me think about it Once you've tried table food can you imagine sucking on one of them bottles you know kno
Really Yeah um when we kept her gave her she had one about about well it's always nap time like 1030 in the morning around 1000 one around 200 or 300 and then one at nighttim
And it's getting old by about bet we spend $18000 if not more dollars month on formul
God Because he heyou know am and he's bottle freak And don't know but can't afford that much longer and figure well he seems Yeah well he's 10 months ol
It's almost time to to Well I from the day mean from the day that mine turned year old started buying whole mil
Absolutely Because even and Tony said she's complaining the other day she's saying you know between Jasmine and Darnell she said I bu
It's like normally they'll drink whole gallon and start on the second every day soyou're looking at at least eight or nine gallons wee
So you're still saving some but Well I'm ready for it but now he's decided he'd eat the real foo
And then last night my brother had this surgery and we went over there and Mark said Well guess we'll take chicken because that's the fastest thing So he went in KFC and got one of those buckets with the slaw and everythin
And um shredded up little pieces of chicken and mashed potatoes and goes through these phases where he never eats and you know he never eat
But he ate that up and Mark said today He acts like he's little constipated And said Well when you get in there try and get me some fruit because when Colleen started eating real slow when she got hooked in cheese that was i
am Renee Cheezem and I'm doing an interview with Burt Cheezem on March 12th um how old are you Burt 4
And Burt you understand from the form that you signed that this um interview is part of research project on storytelling and wonder what your earliest memories of stories being told to you as child might b
Those would be stories of parents and grandparents experiences they had in the depression wars and things like tha
Can you remember the first story that you can remember anyone telling you some of the first memories of someone telling you story Well it would probably been things like living back in the hills of TN and having to ride mule to school things like tha
Were there other people who told you stories when you were very young grandparents perhaps Grandparents grandfathers told me things about things he did when he was younger and construction carpenter and places things he'd been things he'd buil
Do you remember anyone in your family telling you stories that were just maybe made up stories or funny stories Well don't think that too many of them were made up some of them seemed kind of funny at the tim
Do you remember any specific ones that you could retell Well remember tales about some of our relation
For example my uncle in FL who uh had his own airplane and decided one thing he always wanted to do was land his airplane on the highway so he arranged one day to coincidentally run out of gas nowhere near an airport so he could have the experience of landing his plane on the highway and taxiing up to gas station to fill it up and take off agai
So you're not sure if this was true story or made up story within your famil
know it's true that he landed on the highway we had the newspaper clippings to prove i
 Reading stories to you  Can you remember the very first stories that were read when you were little Probably one of the first ones that was ever read to me the first one can remember is my cousins Mary and Glenda reading Trumpet the Do
Can you retell the story Can you remember all the details of the story basically Pretty muc
And one day the fox got in the hen house and he went running barking and nobody wanted to believe it was him and he finally drug him out there and lo and behold there it wa
How old would you say you were when your cousins were doing this reading Well was about three at the tim
They were let's see Mary was probably seven or eight Glenda was about 10 or 1
So your younger cousin was just beginning reader herself reading stories to you And you remember that one because it was read often or it was your favorite Yeah it was one of the ones we read pretty often it was also the first one learned to rea
Did you have any family storytelling rituals story at bedtime reading Bible story or any of those sorts of things Uh not real continuous or anythin
Who in your family would have been most likely to read to read this you story or tell you story Probably depended on which night it wa
Did you have lots of storybooks at your house that were read to you BC We always had books lots of book
You said that you remembered the story of Trumpet the Dog and your cousins reading to yo
Uh did that go on for long time until you were able to begin reading stories on your own spent lot of time at my cousin's house from about the time was about three probably was about eight or nin
Even after you said that you learned to read the story of Trumpet the Dog after you began to read on your own did sometimes your cousins or other people still read or tell stories to you even though you could read Ye
What was well you clearly remember this story but once you got little older and could remember little better what would you say some of your favorite stories and books were as child growing up How old are you talking about Oh elementary school ag
Well probably the favorite book had this is little different had The Giant Golden Book of Astronomy which got when was in the second grade and read it cover to cover till wore it ou
It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was going on at the time it was real interestin
So that one you really enjoyed and you read over and over again What about um what about and it was of course it sounds like true book scientific book about stars and spac
What about fictional stories Do you remember storybooks or children's novels that you read growing up or you like My grandfather had real interesting history book
They were sort of semifactual fiction history people in the history of the country like stories of George Washington growing up some of the explorers of the West Lewis and Clark Fremont Carson people like tha
 So you really liked historical and nonfiction kinds of things But also know that you like fantasy as well Science fictio
And you learned to read quite young didn't you was four years old at the tim
If remember correctly the stories that your mother has told me you pretty quickly progressed to reading serious you moved pretty quickly from Trumpet the Dog to more heavyweight reading materials didn't you Yeah guess s
Um do you um do you remember any particular books or stories that you feel like had an impact on you as you grew into adulthood stories that maybe the message of the book or story has had real impact on your life I'd say quite fe
Well let's see there's guess one of the favorite author's of mine is Isaac Asimov who wrote some of the best science and science fiction that was ever writte
Do you think that um reading these books when you were teenage and older elementary school student had some impact in your career decisions to study mathematics and more technical subjects It's kind of a which is the cause and which is the effect questio
read lot of other authors that weren't weren't as good writers but also had interesting idea
When you think back to when you were younger and people were telling stories to you and reading stories to you um it sounds like the time you spent with your cousins and with your family when all this was happening is time in your life that you remember real fondly Ye
Now that that you're an adult obviously and have had children of your own what stories do you remember telling to your own children and reading to your own children Well let's se
All The Little Monster Books can't remember what the individual names of them were but I've read them all multiple time
RC Do you remember telling them not only reading to them but telling them stories as well some of the stories that were perhaps told to you that maybe you been passed down to the
And your own stories Yeah how my own stories about hard my life was laugh and all those sorts of thing
Do you um what kinds of things do you read now other than some authors that you like mentione
Real currently what do you enjoy reading at the present What writers Let's see recent authors You've probably never heard of any of these but Gregory Benford is very good these are science fiction uh see David Grant science fiction that is real goo
Uh Asimov he died about years ago but still find one or two of his that hadn't read ye
We were mentioning we were mentioning writers you enjoy reading now and we had to take brea
Let's see the others that could think of that read recently there were some Civil War books written by Jeffrey Shaara and the other by his son Michae
It is narrative of the three year long trip they took from Washington DC all the way out to the Pacific Ocean and bac
Now lot of people would probably look at that and think my goodness I'm not sure I'd want to read all those details  tri
What did you enjoy about reading the Lewis and Clark journals Well this was this was the first time that anyone had ever traveled here and recorded any of their experiences and they saw the entire western half of the continent for the first tim
No one else been there no one else had ever experienced or written about what they'd seen and brought it bac
So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in Kind o
It was something that they were in position to do one time and no one before or no one since could ever reduplicate i
Some people think that storytelling in our culture is is uh vanishing because of television and computerized games and email and so many other things that keep people from sharing stories and taking the time to rea
Do you think that story telling continues to be important and why think it's important because it's the real link you have to your past and heritage and it's also declining for the same reasons you mentione
People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going they just get too busy or too laz
How do you try to counter that with your own children and will continue to try and counter that as grandchildren are added to your family As have opportunities as situations arise in the family such as motorcycle purchasing and things like tha
And now that know your own son is considering purchasing motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make  wise decision
Well thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview and for you helping with the research project at UNC
am Meredith Combs and it is March 8 2000 and am interviewing my mother Jane Combs Um what can you tell me about the stories that you first remember being told as child U
It was series of little fiction stories and my mother must have read me every single one of the
Bear Squash You All Flat um just they were just little stories about animals and they had Big Golden Books and Little Golden Books and my mother know she bought me every one of them and read them to m
Did your dad read to you too Sometimes but remember my mother reading to me the mos
Um how old do you remember being Um well know it was before was five probably know at least four and I'm sure she read to me before tha
Um what do you remember any stories they told you your parents told you You mean like imaginary or fictional stories They made up stories sometimes my mother in particular she made up storie
In fact think she still does now But she made up lot of stories then um sometimes they had us my sister and me in the stories and then sometimes the just were from don't know wher
But she was very imaginative and creative and she made up lots of little stories for u
Did they ever tell you factual stories about the area that you lived in Oh yes yes they di
They told me lots of family stories about people that knew about my grandparents and my greatgrandparents and um lots of family stories history history of the people we knew or heard abou
Um beyond my grandparents hadn't seen any of them guess but they began to take on personality and something could kind of see in my imaginatio
Um what kind of things did you remember reading when you started to read Um read some of the same books that they had read to me first and then as got older just got hungry for book
They had bookshelves um that my daddy built that were built in bookshelves and he um they were filled up with books and one summer remember when was teenager just made it mission to read as many of those books as could and plowed they were fiction most of the
Do you remember the names of any of them They were um they were bestseller type fiction from the um 40's and 50's and 60's and on just they were members of book club and they got lot of books that wa
Um well let's see so do you think that those experiences helped you figure out the kinds of things you liked to read Like what the stories that they told you and read to you did Well they must have because still read fictio
love to read just plain history um it must have rubbed off in some aspect because that's the kind of thing still rea
Um well do you think it also helped when you became parent that you naturally wanted to read to your kids Yeah I'd always been reade
I'd always been read to so think yes mean did read to my children to you guys to you and your brother
Um another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it children's songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things but we sang them to
We learned all of those and the fairy tales the classics she read all of those to u
Original poetry that she Not really original no it was uh poems by wellknown authors that you'd find in book but she had to memorize lot of them and she but she read us children's poems too out of books books that were written for childre
Well as teacher do you see reading as something that is still important in families today think lot of parents are still reading to their young childre
They're going to lessons for this and that and sports and they're playing interactive games with their computer and uh watching TV and think really they're not reading on their own like maybe we did when was that age because we didn't have all those other things to d
They're still few that you get in the classroom who are avid readers and they just stand ou
The others you can see in things like vocabulary and um just their general knowledge of things um they're not reading anymor
They don't even watch the news but they're not reading the newspapers or new magazines or anythin
Does it affect their comprehension think it probably does because they're just not reading as muc
Um the good students the ones who do well academically they're going to do OK anyway but the ones um there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading either being read to or reading on their own for pleasure Righ
OK well um going back to you do you think uh are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories and literacy um being exposed to literacy has um affected you in your life Hmm well had some teachers that were really um influential about what read and their love for literatur
don't know rather how much it directly affected the fact that was an English major in college but know that um it didn't hurt to like to read when you have that major um there were some times remember fifth grade teacher and seventh grade teacher who were especially um full of the love for reading and literature and they made that come alive for me as studen
So hope somehow along the way that I've been able to pass that along to my kiddie
Well um is there anything else you'd like to add can't think of anything but it's been nice chatting with yo
This is story that my dad told me when was small long time ago that there was girl that she was very young she was going to go visit her parent
And she was she was going very too fast and she crashed and then she um she goes there um every year she comes out at night and then one time guy passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can if he can take her home to her parents hous
And he goes Yeah sure I'll take you And then he took her and she told him that was her house right there so he left her ther
And two days later he came and visit her and then he knocked on the door and asked for her and his her his mom her mom told her told him that she she wasn't here because she was dead for long time and he goes How can it be But that he brought her two days later and that's what happene
And every year she comes out at night and asks people for rides home because she never get she never got chance to go visit her her parent
Not really Any stories from your grandpa aunt uncle Na that's the only one they told m
Is there favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you No they didn't no just that on
Um well um we wanted to talk about um favorite story and um do you have favorite story favorite story about anything About anythin
Uh who Did you read this story itself yourself when you were young or was it first told to you by someone No it was first told to me by my grandmother who is um was my first teacher and remains my her
How old were you when she shared this story with you My first recollection was thre
Well this story and must tell you haven't read this in The Bible so don't know if it's totally accurate but prefer to get it like this There was huge crowd of people and um Jesus decided that what he wanted to do was to uh entertain the little childre
And all the adults were standing around not really paying much attention to the children because children of course were supposed seen and uh not heard and not really much being seen actuall
And Jesus uh actually made all the adults move aside and let the little children come u
And he said Suffer the little children In other words you know it might be painful for you or inconvenient for you adult people but Let the children come to me and forbid them not don't stop them from comin
And he sat and talked with these little children and he hugged them and loved them al
And she told me that everyone has to be like little child to God and that God loves everyone just like He is their own father and they are His children because of what they ar
And that children actually the innocence of children the unconditional love of children is the way that we now that I'm an adult that adults need to be with each other and that the greatest lesson in that when you can be like little child then you are doing what's pleasing to Go
And also and the thing that resonated with as kid was that you always had special place and special protection and special love uh from Jesus and God and that was another thing that made me feel special as little gir
So could you reiterate the message quoteunquote um that you got from the story from your point of view The message again that get from the story for me personally was that there would always be special connection between me and God and actually was just another of the ways my grandmother put for me to learn or believe that could do anything could be anything because had special connection and special protection um from not only her which was more important for me at the tim
But also from God and that that would always be there that the way that she was able to do it was actually by remembering to me to be more childlike more innocen
And that keeps me as an adult one remembering to pray like child and to maintain some of the innocence which is difficult of chil
Um as child what did you like most about the story as opposed to what you would like most about it now Were they the same or different N
And you know with this you know it wasn't many opportunities for kids to be special because kids weren't you know you were pushed out of adult conversation and just really pushed to the sid
Do you have chance to retell this story um in your work or to your own children How have you shared it over the years Well you know it's really interesting that we're talking about this because my son who is now 28 guess shared it with my children when they were growing up but not in any particular special way but my son is in therapy now and uh this is one of the visioning exercises that this therapist told him that he should do whenever he is angry to imagine that he is one of the little children that Jesus is putting his arms aroun
And so he came home and told me about that and he and had discussion about that and it took me back to the safety and this warm feeling had when was ki
think in my work what remember to do and what write into every single class that facilitate OK no matter what it is if it's leadership conflict no matter what is what call STAR mode
And all of that is the same feeling from that story that had when was ki
And try to tell people this is the environment you want to try to tell my students to encourage them to embrace the kind of environment where it's safe to agree or disagree to discuss anythin
don't say words like Love and don't mention Jesus don't talk about any deity um because that's part of the respect to
If they want to say Working from the universe or Good business sense or God don't care what they call i
Um let them use whatever words to describe the behaviors that is gonna get you ther
So it's that same feeling that is created in my workshops that had when was kid actuall
You um tantalized me with the reference to your grandmother and that she is still your her
Could you describe her Hmm Describe her and what she did Why she's my hero Righ
What attributes did she have that made you um respect her and view her as your hero even to this day She had the ability to first of all she didn't know any stranger
And having first met someone she had the ability to quickly make them feel they had been in the family and not only in the family but loved member and close member of the famil
She would make everyone feel comfortable respected and more than that truly loved truly truly loved everyon
And as little girl being blessed to grow up with her lived with her and my grandfather and my brother and I lived with them until was six years old exclusivel
My mother was working and that was fine the best thing she could have ever done to take me to my grandparent
And she really just instilled in me sense of centering and acceptance of who am clarity of understanding that could really do anything that put my mind t
sense of strong independence to the point that never had never had the problem of worrying about peer pressur
When was in elementary school high school or college never ever did have that thing with my friends like smoking so had to smok
didn't none of that because was very much my own individual and very centered and grounde
She would correct me when was wrong very lovingly but never ever doubted that she loved me neve
Um and I to this day live my life um for the most part in ways that I'm always seeking her approval and think she is my touchstone and my benchmar
So you know have my standards and match my standards to what her standards would have been believ
How old were you when she passed She died in 1982 so what does that make me was born in 194
mean they're so handinglove that sort of see it as one seamless piece that you've share
Was there anything that failed to ask that should have relating to this story that you've told or background to the story that you've told No would want to thank you for asking me those questions though because it's given me the opportunity to go back to very precious place to feel her love really really present and um you know that makes me smile all ove
Well the magic is that she can be in two places at once because feel it to
OK uh this is story little while back when uh me and uh two friends in the ninth grade got wild har
And uh it was winter night and it had just begun to snow and uh in Shelby it don't really snow that much so we were all pretty excite
And uh we were all spending the night at Craig's house and uh we decided we wanted to sneak out of the hous
Well it was about 100 in the morning and uh Craig was scared we were going to wake his parents up or his mom u
And uh you know after little while we ended up talking him into it and uh so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um we proceeded to uh go over to uh girl's house that we knew named Mary Ann
And uh so we all snuck out of the house and uh we walked through the snow and it was real cold and we didn't really have any warm clothes on because you know we aren't really used to the snow that muc
And uh we had proceeded over to this uh girl's house and uh she uh let us in the house when we get over there and uh we uh stayed there and watched movie with he
And uh you know mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um 430 500 in the mornin
And uh she's her dad works uh construction so uh she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh we hurry up and get out of the house and uh we're walking on the way home and uh we're seeing the uh newspaper car running around throwing newspapers ou
And uh don't know who thought of it don't know if it was me or Jeff or Craig but uh we uh we had some cigarettes on us and we were smoking trying to be the big rebels you know and we had lighte
And uh one of us thought of the idea of sticking newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fir
So uh one of us we were walking down the road picked up uh newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh this was uh metal mailbox with uh brick around i
And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into big old flame you know lit up the whole sk
And mean we were just you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh we were walking along little further and we saw another newspaper and uh we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbo
So uh we were like Cool and we lit it up again and uh this big old flame shot out and we all ran of
And uh as we got closer to Craig's house that we were staying at we came by uh it was plastic mailbox and uh so we uh stuffed the newspaper in it and lit it on fire and we we weren't really thinking and all the sudden the newspaper caught on fire and then the whole mailbox caught on fir
We came up to uh newspaper mailbox that was plastic and we lit that on fire we actually set couple of those on fire and uh mean by this time mean you could the sun you could almost see the sun coming up so we run as fast as we can to get back to Craig's house and we sneak back into the back window and uh we go to slee
OK we uh went to sleep and uh about an hour and half later about 800 in the morning uh Craig's mom comes in to wake us up and says there's two guys that want to see us at the front doo
And uh so we walked to the foyer area of the front house at the front door and uh these two old men say uh ask us uh what we were doing last nigh
And we were like We didn't do anything last night and Craig's mom asked us you know did we sneak out last night and we all said No no We denied it and uh the old man said the old man asked us you know Did you mean he said Did you or did you not sneak out and burn any mailboxes And we just denied the whole thing you know and uh finally the old man says Well you know wouldn't have never thought it was y'all but uh seeing it was snowing last night and uh foot tracks go all the way from my mailbox to this house right here uh don't have any choice but to believe it was y'all And uh he said Especially the fellow that was wearing these soles that say Vivran on them and uh Craig has his boots sitting by the door and looked on the bottom of them and had uh the sole had uh was written it said Vivran on the bottom of i
And he said These soles right here match right up to it And uh we were just like Damn uh so uh we finally confessed to it and uh we told him yeah we did we were out ther
Found out later that the uh one of the old men got up every morning about 530 and uh walked the uh around the neighborhood and he saw us uh do it actuall
And uh he just followed our footprints back to the house and waited until earlier the next morning to uh come to say anythin
So we thought we were being sneaky but uh found out the whole time we were being watche
And uh so after that uh the uh old man that we burned his mailbox down uh told us that uh he was going to he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbo
So uh that whole day think we put up two newspaper mailboxes uh one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the groun
And uh so it was uh not very good night for us not very good da
And uh but one of the cool things that happened was uh that morning in the paper in the write up columns with police reports and they had little column had what we had did that night and it said they were looking for suspects but uh said but they never followed through on that the guy never pressed charges or anything like that so uh we got off easy on tha
Do you got another one Uh Do you want me to turn it off so you can think Uh nah got it uh another story uh when I uh this happened uh senior year over the summer after my graduating senior yea
Uh live out on Moss Lake it is in Shelby North Carolina Cherryville actually uh me and buddy of mine from way back in elementary school we were best friends back then uh invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lak
have jet ski and he's got one too and uh so we we went out there and started drinking couple of beer
And uh we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and uh we were out in the water and uh we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and uh he uh runs his jet ski up on land and we had to pull it back and put it in wate
And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty uh inebriated guess you'd call it and uh we were out there just acting stupid on the jet ski
And uh at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and uh bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and got big bruise on my legs but I'm not feeling it then I'm pretty well gone by this tim
And uh it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and uh put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh we're going to go back to his house to take it bac
So uh we get it back on the trailer and we find out that uh we bent the handlebar on i
So we take it back to my house and uh we are sitting there trying to bend it back and uh so his parents don't get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whateve
So uh we are at the house trying to bend it back and my parents come down and they are like Are y'all all right We're like Yeah yeah we're fine you kno
And uh they're like All right but they they didn't have any idea that we were uh that we were leaving and we were going to take the uh jet ski back to his hous
So uh we get the handlebar bent back and uh we take off and um we are on the way to his house and uh run off the road at one poin
And uh the trailer the trailer doesn't hit anything but at one point it hits mailbox and my friend asked if was all right and said Sure I'm fine you know had no idea what was doing so we get to his house and uh found out my parent's had uh called over there beforehand to tell his parents to come out there and meet me and take me home when got ther
Well when got there uh just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off and just jetted right out all of the sudden you know his parents didn't even know we had got there and uh my friend Eric and he asked me again Are you OK to drive and was like Yeah sure you kno
But uh I'm coming on the way home and not really paying that much attention and uh just got this truck about year ago before this and uh end up not looking at the road don't know what the heck was doin
didn't know it was happening and uh the side view mirror glass all of the sudden just felt this bang and looked up and saw had glass on m
And swerved and uh luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and bounced off the telephone pole and it was still going and uh had no mean was just totally in shoc
The first thing do is got cell phone on me so call uh call friend of mine that uh lives real close to where hit the telephone pole is a
And drive to her house and uh get her to uh drive my truck the rest of the way hom
 Ended up taking about all my summer wages that earned that summer to pay to fix i
What is your occupation My occupation work for Bank Of America and work on a uh websit
Um when do you remember hearing stories as child Uh remember hearing stories as child when basically my mother reading stories to me not so much my father but more my mother when was can't even tell you how old wa
But just know for fact as child my mother would read to me before went to be
But one sticks out and it's still um at our home in New York and whenever go back up there always see the book lying around um in my room actually or on the bookshel
So that's that's the that's the main story that remember that that sticks in my head as far as my mother reading it to myself and my sister when we were younge
Can you tell little bit about it or do you remember anything Um think the one thing remember mostly about it actually is just the the front cover of i
And it was just a uh uh small boy it looked like on the edge of lake and he was doing something either like feeding you know the swan or holding out his hand to it or something to that effec
Do you remember hearing stories that your parents would tell you as child maybe about their past or Oh yea
can remember my uh my father telling me um the story of my grandparents coming from uh Italy when uh they came ove
also remember uh my mother telling me lot of stories about uh how hard it was for her when she was growing up because uh there was about think she was one of um four siblings and um my grandmother never really worked or anything like tha
So remember my mother telling me all kinds of interesting stories about my grandfather as far as uh he was New York City cop um you know and worked in a he was bailiff in in court you know for the New York courts for awhile like at the same time actually and he was also doing like a security job as wel
Do you read stories now Uh read books and and magazines if that that counts as as storie
I'm not really uh into uh lot of the nonfictions though occasionally I'll read biography or uh something like that if if you know see something in bookstor
The The Dungeons and Dragons type stuff and even up until um you know still enjoy reading that kind of stuff about you know swords and magic that kind of stuf
And also tend to um hear about authors from you know friends or or hear of famous book from friend and I'll read one and if there happens to be series on it then you know I'll start reading thos
actually just started reading uh the first three books of the Harry Potter series and think those are intended for much younger audience but I've actually read all the first three that have come out and I've enjoyed them cause that's basically it's about kid who's magician basically finds out that he's magicia
So when you first started to read you tended towards the fantasy books Um yeah when started to be able to decide what wanted to read as opposed to having somebody read it to me tended to lean more towards yeah fantasytype book
Is there story that changed in significance as you've gotten older Like maybe you've read you remember hearing book and then you heard it again or read it again that changed in meaning or meant something different to you Uh yeah actuall
remember my parents actually read to me um Watership Down which is story about bunch of rabbits who um get driven out of wherever they're living forget the technical term for for what their home under under the ground is called but they get driven out of that and they have to go and basically find new place to liv
So remember my parents read that to me and thought it was just really like cute about the rabbits kind of thin
And think they might have skipped lot of pages too because actually read it in high school and it turns out it was like you know somewhat of violent boo
Like some of the rabbits get killed and it's it's much more deeper and it's actually it has like political undertones to it cause it's you know different factions of rabbits you know kind of like fighting against each other and you know it was really interestin
So that that kind of that story like remember being younger and hearing it and thinking like oh it was cute because it was rabbits and then reading it and actually you know en enjoying it lot more when was in high school cause it was actually really really good boo
I I'd read to children but probably not I'd probably tend to read to my own childre
Um don't know how much I'd be into reading to just you know like a program of just reading to children kind of thin
But when do have children I'm going make sure that either um you know my wife reads to them or that you know or make it point that read to them cause think it's it's really importan
And actually uh my sister has two young children and um she's constantly reading to to her child and who's two years old no
And she just seems like pretty bright intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I've that I've encountere
Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you're going to tell your children Um yea
Um to tell you the truth I'll definitely tell my kids you know things about you know stories about when was growing up and maybe some things that you know you should or shouldn't d
Um know when was really younger I'll tell them this story about never going near uh frozen pond because when was really young um the lake by my house had frozen over actually it was just pond but it was pretty big one um and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on i
And it started to um get warmer outside but there was still layer of ice on top of it and bunch of my friends had gone out on to the the doc
It was attached to kind of like the shore but at the deep end of the pon
And we were out there and one of my friends was kidding around and think we were in like about seven or eight years ol
Um and one of my friends was joking around on it and actually fell through the ic
And uh bystander had to come over and basically fish him out and the kid could've die
Do you think your parents told you stories more out of humor or more out of as warning Like about stories about growing up with them or their pas
Do you think they used their stories as teachable moments Yeah think they had mixture because think um it's kind of like two different you know things that they would tell me as far as storie
You had the things that they would read out of books which were purely for entertainment it always seemed lik
Um and then if it was anything that was you know that kind of correlated with if it wasn't coming from book they were probably trying to get something into my hea
So it was kind of like if it was coming out of book knew it was for pure entertainment whereas if it was something they were telling to me might be little more receptive to you know maybe trying to find little little meaning behind it and say Hey why are you why are you telling me this Now your grandparents or greatgrandparents came from Italy Uh my grandparent
Can you think of anything Um yeah mean they just they mostly they didn't really talk about what it was like being over ther
Like from the time when they came over here that was hard for them at first to adjus
And how they came over with with basically you know nothing or you know not not that many possessions looking for a looking for better life and you know just how they had to work hard to get you know where they wer
And that they their entire lives they were just trying to make better life for my dad and his siste
But more of like the actual journey over and and what it was like to first come her
This is David Emrich and he also grew up in Philadelphia and he's lived in Charlotte for is it almost three year
When you were growing up do you remember reading book that uh you particularly liked and you remember or do you remember someone reading you book that you particularly liked Se
When was growing up the books remember the most of were like The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Frank Swift and those kind of really um you know just serial serializations of books and those were the books that remember firs
don't remember any specific mysteries or anything like that just remember reading dozens of them really until was probably seven or eight years ol
Is there any particular reasons why you chose those books to read over others think that was given them as gif
The other because would and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew knew liked to rea
And they were it would it would generally be series and like for example remember now I now recall uh I'd gotten series uh they'd come in box sets at Christmas and they'd be paperbox paperbacks in box with eight or ten books in the
And remember reading like uh remember reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries this way and remember reading books by JR
Tolkien uh you know Lord of the Rings and you know all those books the same wa
So guess that these were the mean my parents knew liked to read and would always for Christmas or my birthdays or or um you know anytime gift was appropriat
would get other gifts of course but not only also get something like this every yea
Were mean obviously your parents thought reading was important because they'd give you books because they knew you liked to rea
Did they like when you were younger maybe you couldn't read did they ever read anything to you that you remember Hu
Um did as you got older did they types of book change Did you still like mystery type books As got older Let's see You know ten eleven or twelve By the time got to be ten eleven or twelve mean remember would read the books that were assigned in school and really like those like you know the seventh grade readers usually that John Knowles Separate Peace remember reading that and it was very good and remember reading um um Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding which was was the type of book that was assigned the
remember reading very specifically uh uh history of the German rocketry program during WWII that reading you know was just thirteen or fourteen year old bo
Uh remember actually remember reading book it was on the best seller list at the time it was uh it was probably written in the late seventies and it was called The Third World War and it was it was uh it was written as if it were factual but it was uh um sort of fictionalized account of what of a of potential third world war and remember the funny thing remember was read this book like after it was probably 77 or 78 and the war took place according to this book in like 85 or '8
wouldn't say lived in dread but always little afraid of that year That this was the year that these these events would come true and that there would be Third World Wa
In fact remember it was seventh grade remember because in this particular book the Soviet Union at that point had used um nuclear weapons against Birmingham England um and had uh and that's what caused their coalition to unravel because none of the coalition partners wanted any part of that and that was what eventually caused them to lose the wa
But remember doing creative writing piece for seventh grade reading class um where invented series of newspaper articles surrounding that particular even
The fact that the Soviet Union had launched nuclear attacks various parts various uh you know cities around the worl
So you used what you had read to actually you you wrote about things you'd actually read Yeah I'd Created your own writing system Actually what did was imagined that this was that was news reporter writing for the New York Times or whatever Hu
And you know made up big headline you know Such And Such City Destroyed you know give byline you know give date and time and then just start writing what I what thought were journalistic articles at that point about that event event which had read about in book which had imagine
Um did do you remember any particular stories that were told to you when you were child Well ah don't remember my parents reading anything do remember being in grade school and being in the library and the librarian reading James and the Giant Peach to u
And we would go to forget how often we'd go to library like you know maybe it was once week maybe it was three times week but everytime we'd go we'd all sit on the rug we'd sit Indian style crosslegged and uh I'm sure it's very politically incorrect at this point but the librarian could never say that toda
Um and then she would read us you know chapter at time of James and the Giant Peac
Did you look forward to reading or hearing her read James and the Giant Peach Yeah sure did think think enjoyed James and the Giant Peac
In fact remember few years ago they made movie of it and thought I ought to go see that but guess it didn't do so well and it fizzled and never saw it n
Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger now Uh Maybe not now but you know within the last four or five years Righ
Besides um things like you know first off what mentioned before it would it could be adult reading like um Separate Peace or Lord of the Flies remember rereading those in college just because wanted to reread the
Um but don't don't remember rereading anything that read when was kid that that I that reread as an adul
Do you like now um asked Megan the same question but now do you are there any family stories that you either remember or you like think are bizarre or you know would like to hear again Well mean don't think that uh my family generally doesn't sit around telling stories about what people did years ago or that kind of thing years ago there is one event remember um no mean there's few things few things remember or have memories of but it isn't like anyone sits around telling stories about the
Certainly the memory have is different than the stories that that uh the family swaps around the table or anything like tha
So like you remember specific events remember general things remember one time we were at the shore my fam my grandfather had house in Stone Harbor and there was hurricane and remember um you know we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and you know and we we doubletied the awning dow
During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh uh you know all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away but don't remember you now don't think we'd sit around and telling that story mean occasionally mention tha
You don't elaborate on it much No no but remember it like um most of my memories of of childhood memories guess were were of that beach house and you know my grandmother and my mother and my sisters would stay there during the week and then on the weekend the men would come down like the men meaning my grandfather and my father and that kind of thin
But don't remember we we don't generally sit around and swapping stories about it mean we just last week we were at the whole family again went to this time North Carolina beac
My Mom rented house there and we you know think at that point just because you know being at the beach remember things and would say You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and We talked about some other things then but it wasn't like we sat around telling hilarious tales and laughing over dinner and things like tha
All right this is um Megan Emrich and she she grew up in Philadelphia and she's lived here since May April March April April firs
All right Megan when you were growing up do you remember any stories that you read or were read to you that uh stick in your mind don't remember any stories that rea
remember reading the uh um my Nana and we were just talking about this at Christmastime my Nana had read story had wanted me to read book and we had gone to her apartment and she was um reading The Owl and the Pussycat and she would read it with me think just to teach me how to how to read basically but remember and apparently that was her favorite story or something like that but remember being forced to sit down and read it with her and really didn't want to do it but always remembe
can remember now the beginning part of it and that's really all can remember of the stor
Did um was this at particular time of the year like did you say at Christmas or holidays Wheneve
This was not at Christmas this was whenever we would go over and visit visit he
don't even know The Owl and the Pussycat the book or poem I'm not really sur
She always sat down and read this with her and I always thought was being punished by sitting there having to read i
Um Did did she like read it to you or She would read it with m
But could always remember you know The Owl and the Pussycat in the beautiful peagreen book and that's what remember but don't really remember enjoying i
just thought was being punished because every my brother and sister could do whatever they wanted and had to sit there and read The Owl and the Pussycat you know wasn't too happy about tha
Do you know why she made you sit there Did she ever make your brother and sister sit there No don't remember them having to sit ther
She did this every time you'd go over there like on regular basis Yeah It seemed like i
This was before this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me was not even sure what was going on but um but just remember having to read that and that was it um with he
Do you remember in your family any particular stories that were told like you know at Thanksgiving or just maybe even now stories that you uh know you remember when so and so did such and such Um no but always not really stories guess hearing my mom talk about stories about her her brother and her mother and stuff like that things never even knew about that would interest me now that she tells me no
It was just you know we just went on with our lives but now now as am older she would tell me things that you know never even knew abou
Lived with we lived with the whole time but never even knew about so it was little differen
Is there something particular or like really weird that she's told you that stands out in your min
Well she told me she just told me last week that my her mother had breast cancer and never knew tha
It never came up don't think she ever you know she ever kept it secret or anything like that but don't just she just never told me it never came out in conversatio
Um are there any you said you don't remember reading anything in particular like when you were older in school were there any books that you read that you liked or hated Um no to be honest never read any of the books was supposed t
That's why didn't graduate college but never never read any of the books was supposed t
mean remember having to read um you know all the all the books that everyone don't know John Steinbeck books and stuff like tha
Um my parents had small house on very friendly suburban street and ah one summer day remember going out to the back of our yard which seemed really big the
Uh reached into my parents small garden it had quite few tomatoes in it and just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence and kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence and then my next door neighbor who was probably about four my playmate at the time he rode his Big Wheel down the down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having great time not thinking about anything laughing having lot of fun Then dad had to spoil it al
He came he opened the door and remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face and could tell that he was disappointe
He wasn't happy with me but wasn't wasn't really sure if what had done was really really wrong just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me needed to come into the house and I came over there and stepped up and didn't even say Bye to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing didn't really notice at that time probably just went into the hous
Faulk's yard so he told me that was in trouble and was going to get spanking and um was kind of uh uh looking for an out so was smart enough to say Hey Dad Before you give me spanking why don't you just let me have one big glass of chocolate milk first So anyway Dad goes and makes this nice big glass of chocolate milk for m
I'm not even sure why he did it but spent so much time drinking that chocolate milk it was must have had that chocolate milk to my face for 20 minutes and for some reason you know Dad was telling me you know talking to me about uh you know what what had done and you know how it was wron
remember yeah remember that based on later conversations that with him about it but at the time guess really wasn't sure what it was about but knew that when it all came down to the bottom of it knew that what had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm going to probably have to go down there and help Mr
Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done and remember being little bit nervous about tha
Faulk very well she was about 80 and ah she was nice person had seen her few times but was really nervous about tha
It was probably the first thing remember from being little kid about ah especially about something that I'd done wron
Ah another thing that happened there that thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister and that was in that very same backyar
There was a ah rose garden back there and my sister it's ironic her middle name is Ros
Her name is Christy Rose Farrow and she was back there with me and we're going back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose and remember watching her put the petals up there and remember watching her put the petals up her nose and wasn't really sure why she was doing i
didn't really ask any questions just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it so was like keeping going keep going Yes This is great you know and she's stuffing the petals up there and didn't really know of any consequence
don't think was just kind of was about four or four and half and remember stuffing those petals up her nose and thought it was great and then Mom comes down and she was really disappointed in both of u
think she was most unhappy with me because you know ah ah Christy was only one or one and half or two and was the big brother so from there guess remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took long time to take them out there was lot of them up there but ah later on as grew older we moved around lot when was kid remember the first day woke up and there was moving truc
One day woke up and there was moving truck in my in my yard and woke up to this sound of that and looked out the window and there's this moving truck and there's people moving stuff in and got up and said Mom they're taking our stuff and was and she was like Yes we're moving today and was about four going on five at the time and so they're taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said you know I told you we're movin
You must have forgot and must have because it totally took me by surprise and we ended up at new place and remember this this new house that we were at and ah in pretty area and it had much bigger yard than the on
remembered long driveway and it was surrounded by woods it was really nice area in Arnold MO and um basically it was such shock because when we first got there Mom said Today's your first day of school and apparently had forgot about that too and started to get really nervous about tha
can't remember what it was but suddenly got really nervous that was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my lif
had forgotten that was moving to new place and had forgotten that was uh going to be going to schoo
remember some of my friends remember one time when went to lunch and always had this Pac Man lunchbox pull out this Pac Man lunchbox and would that was so proud of and you know do my thing and would be talking so much and laughing about the stupidest things that wouldn't even wouldn't even eat my lunc
would just laugh the whole time and one time did it so much that never even opened my lunch out of the bag and it was like minute before minute before lunch was over and the teacher the P
You're not eating your lunch come with him so went he had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down corner and he told me had to sit there until ate all my lunch and remember um crying for long time and think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because went from being extremely happy and was extremely sa
Every year we'd go from whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL the whole time was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about week with them in the summer and we'd also go down there for Christmas too but mostly remember going down there every year um for the summer and it was ah lot of arguing in the car and remember sitting next to my uh had two sisters so the middle one was always in the middle for some reaso
What mean by that is that she's the next down she was like two two years younger that me then the other one is three years younger than me so uh basically you know you know she would always sit next to me and we'd get so mad remember my dad swinging directly behind him at us all the time because we'd always be fightin
Was she would eat peanut butter cups and she knows that hate the smell of peanut butter so she would actually eat the peanut butter cup and then breathe in my face and there wasn't really any way for me to defend against that because couldn't think of any food that she really thought stunk and you know it was like it was it was untouchable there wasn't anything could do about that so would would get really mad at that and I'd say Mom Mom and she would say you know She's just breathing so there was really no way out of it so remember lot of tha
So when was in when was at grandma and grandpa's house we used to have great time just fishing and hanging out with grandpa and my cousins would go there and every Fourth of July we'd do firework
Um my grandparents were always very very loving people and some of my parents were and we'd just have great time down ther
And some of my best memories were um at the Fox River in IL with my grandparent
Um um another memory with my family that have is that we had lot of weddings ah and these weddings were always really big weddings and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish you kno
Half of my family's Polish so Polish we have big weddings and remember at my cousin's wedding was like 12 years old going to it and had my cousin Tim and he was about 10 and ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 peopl
He's also really big into the Hell's Angels and he brought about 50 of his friends to it and the wedding took place in hotel one of those classic areas where you have you have the weddings and it was ah basically really stormy night real stormy and the power went out and it was open bar so now we've got ah 50 Hell's Angels no power and it's the middle summer so it is getting really hot in there you know there's there's no lights so you know there's few emergency power lights that people brought ah and they had some sort of battery they were using for the ah for the radio system and it was it was getting really crazy in there because we had Hell's Angels running around without shirts on uh people highly intoxicated remember by 10 year old cousin saying Bottom's up Thomas Bottoms up and the reason it was bottoms up was because was they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that's something can never figure out and if you're kid you get champagne if you're an adult you get champagn
Everybody gets champagne and some people don't drink it so what's left the kids drink so we were going around drinking all this champagn
And before you know it it's time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they've got stage of course there they do it's one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they're playing this tune can't remember what it was and Tim and were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it think it's really pretty funny um it was uh it was really neat experienc
get call it's about 930 in the morning and get call from the partner Bucky the big ma
AF I need you to do something for me Um You need to call Ramona at Concord mind you she's at an office actually she's in client all the way across town we're in Monroe she's in Concor

So have to go she gave me like three or four clients to look up and then under each one of those have to like open up all like the Excel spreadsheets and don't even know what I'm looking for I'm just trying to have an idea of what it kind of looks lik
Then get it and I'm like great What do do with it It's like one file with whole bunch of tabs of different you know each tab has like different spreadsheet on i
So finally get the thing and it has like eight different parts to it and I'm just there trying to figure how the thing goes together how one number flows to another sheet and how that goes you kno
Then was spinning my wheel for about don't know it seemed like all day that da
It wasn't till like 1130 or 1200 that actually got to start on the on the projec
He acted like he needed it soon but the way she had everything done would have had to would have had to start from the very beginning and most of it was just like data entry to start off wit
It wasn't until like before 500 that had finished entering something and was able to look and see OK where do go from here now that have this done where do these totals go to on another sheet So I'm like OK he hasn't called back or anything so I'm figuring can do it on Monda

Now what does that look like And how about it looks like exactly what I'm trying to d
It's like more simplified like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simpl
So here am now have the thing that I'm supposed to have and he wants it today and wasted all that time on Friday just wasted time because was doing the wrong thin
So go in there and haven't even told him yet that had to start from the very beginning because was like didn't want to tell him So and let me tell you got to the point today where was about to qui

Lana came over and sat with me for little bit but she didn't know what to do and um you just get to the point where you know you're like you know you're slamming things down and you're just was pissed was really upset and um got to the point where just wanted to cry and but didn't want to get that upset because you know if anybody came in there or knew had to tell him that would might not be able to finish it today or you know have to start from the beginning but then again didn't know how much detail still didn't know how much detail you know talked to him early in the day it's like you talk to him and it's like he completely avoided my question
No it was just that one time in the morning and she said that she was going to come back to the offic
Well wasn't even thinking about that but was so frustrated and ended up talking to him agai
He didn't say time again so he just got me over there stressing out and really don't even know when it's neede
Usually you feel like you have to work through like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute you know was like  and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and didn't even know she was coming for sur
ate real quick as fast as could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with i
It was like little bit close to five when she came in there and um had two companies that had to do the same thing for so once was finished with the whole first company then had to do the second one and it was like 500 and he hadn't asked for it or anything so u
And asked him you know could do it um Do you need me to stay and do it tonight or could have it done by lunchtime tomorrow if that's OK Well what happens the client walks through the door that needs i
didn't ask him till after she left but anyhow um um she told me that he had come in she basically um no that was afte
And only had one of them done and just kept on doing what was doing because heard them talking or whatever and kept on doing what was doing don't know how he did it but he basically told him that he didn't have it right now or whateve
And here am thinking he's going come in there and be like you know just have it out with me you know just tell me off like how could not have this don
already told him tried to explain to him that was frustrated didn't have all the information neede
So anyway um he ended up coming in there and he was like How's it coming along And was like I'm almost done He was like All right well I'm going go out and run some errands and um just put it up on my shelf and um if have any review notes I'll give them to you in the mornin
And was like OK and that was it So all that stressing and mean had every reason to stress today it was like you're giving something you don't know how to do and it's like here do i
One minute he's banging on the desk the next he's OK have it on my desk dah dah dah dah da
Is it like that all the time Yep whenever he there um which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone lot but whenever he is there and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like you know such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustratin
So what is it that they wanted you to do We were doing um we were doing today it was um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for company that um this guy was looking to buy well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements basically saying they are going to have this much um this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002 going to have 2003 and then going to have so much income and you know like tha
This is Fannie Flono and she grew up in Ag Augusta GA and she is going to talk about some stories from her childhoo
My grandmother used to tell me lot of different stories about her growingup years and uh especially uh she used to talk about her family and what it was like during those time
She had this one story and uh we called my grandmother Granny uh because we had another grandmother we called something else but uh um Granny used to tell this story about her brother Jo
And it was fascinating story because uh it kind of told lot about uh what it was like being uh uh closeknit black family during those those years in the South when uh you didn't have muc
She grew up on farm and um uh what it was like but um like lot of black families during that time uh uh if you had large family uh and some of your relatives didn't have anybody in their family you would just kind of let some of the kids stay with that famil
And my Gran my Granny and her brother um were among think there were six kids in her family and they had cousin uh who lived uh on farm you know maybe about don't know 10 miles away not that fa
You know during that time people walked 10 miles and uh they needed somebody to help with some of the farm chores and all that sort of stuff and so they asked my my my Granny's parents if Joe could come and live with the
And you know they were close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff but it was just down the road you know so they said fine and and you you know he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thin
Um but ah one day he didn't show up on Sunday uh for church and so they wondered what was going on and they went to this house ah down the road and the cousins had packed up and lef
They took Joe with them and my Granny said she said it was such sad time in the house because you know everybody was missing Joe and they didn't know what to d
And so you know eventually you know you know they kept asking people around and nobody knew where they were and eventually you know they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn't see Joe agai
And uh so uh Granny grew up she was like think she told me this was when she was about 10 years old when this happened and her brother Joe was like 16 and uh so she grew up and uh she uh got married and uh that's another stor
She got married when she was 16 to my grandfather who was 30 and she didn't know she had to go live with him but anyway that's another story about ignorance among people but anyway they were sitting on the porch and she was back visiting uh her mother and they were sitting on the porch and it was like this long road it was like the house was like situated at the end of this long road and you could see all the way down the road a long wa
And she said it was just like one day and it was like maybe 10 years later cause she was like 20 and they were just sitting on the porch and they were and she said she said she could still remember because her mother had on you know this big straw hat that she used to have o
It was like her favorite hat and this big voluminous dress that she used to have on in the summertim
It was really cool and the dress kind of blew in the wind little bit Uhhu
And they were just sitting out there on rocking chairs you know just kind of enjoying the afternoon and uh they could look down the road and they could see this dust kicking u
And and she said uh my Granny said she got up and she she looked up and she said You know wonder who that could be And so she sat back down and you know they were still chatting and they could still see this person and this person was walking really really fas
And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking No that can't be that can't be And she said but you know the closer he got she said she got up and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom and she said she said Mama you know think that's Joe And she said then her mama her mama leaned forward and she looked and she said Walks like hi
Got that same walk but she said It can't be So Granny got up and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood ther
And then he was coming she said he was coming really fastshe said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the roadand here he's coming down the road and she turns around and she said It's Joe He's come home And she said she started running toward him and they ran and they hugged and they hugged and she said her mama was sitting on the porch andthis is true storyand her mama was sitting on the porch and she said her mama was just like dumbfounde
She said there were just tears coming down from her eyes and she said then she said Joe came up on the porc
And he said Mama I'm home Where had he been He said that they had gone up Nort
They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this this cousin and they just stayed and he didn't know how to get back so he just stayed with the
He didn't know how to get in touch with them and he said you know you know as he grew up you know he kept thinking about them and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn't have any way he didn't have any mone
And he said finally he know you know once he got grown and started working he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them and he didn't even know if they were going to be in the same plac
But he said he was going to find them and he came all the way bac
No she was born in 1900 because she was 16 and so it must have been like in 1926 19 you know before before 193
Cause they didn't actually live in Augusta they lived in well you know Augusta was still citytown during that time even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isn't that bi
But uh they lived in little country town outside of Augusta called Evans and Evans still exists and that's where lot of my relatives still still are to
So ah and um Granny she used to tell lot of those stories mean especially when talking about Augusta being the big cit
Uh my grandmother Granny her greatgrandfather was white man and one of the the the things that just sticks in her craw is that and you know she she and her sister uh were lighter than some of the rest of the famil
And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were going to move to the city to Augusta and pass for whit
And they moved downtown So her sister's husband was lightskinned too Her sister's husband was lightskinned to
And uh they moved downtown and there was uh and it's still like this in Augusta this big street downtown called Broad Street and it really was just this broad street in downtown are
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in and it was right on the edge of Broad Stree
And uh they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just just determined that they were going to be whit
They just didn't like what it was like being black in those days and that was you know guess that that was probably you know in the early 1930s uh when they did tha
And they they wanted to sever relationships with the rest of the family but the rest of the family didn't want to sever relationships with them even though they were mad at them because they had decided you know to do something they didn't think was righ
My my grandmother was very adamant about you know people who try to be things that they aren't and this whenever she'd tell this story she'd talk about people who try to be things that they aren'
That was the lesson in the story people who try to be things that they aren'
That they shouldn't do that that you should accept your lot in life although you should work to improve it you know you should be who you are and not try to be something els
Um but she used to visit her sister ah in in in Augusta and but she used to have to go in the back door and pretend she was the mai
She hated that and she used to tell her sister every day she said that that You are doing wron
You are doing wrong wrong wrong wrong treating your family this way And so finally somebody apparently told that these people were passing for white and Granny came to visit them at their house and they were gone because they had to get out of town really quickl
And they couldn't stay in the Augusta area because people knew that they had tried to do something that was really taboo and try to pass for whit
Um and so they just left town and she she never did see her sister again never saw her sister agai
And you know the one thing that my my grandmother my grandmother she was so funny about this uh she uh she treated the children mean her her her grandchildren differently based on the color of their ski
And actually when we we kind of began to understand what was going on because my cousins were little lighter well they were somewhat lighter than we were and she would not treat them well and we couldn't figure it out what what was going on you know why you know we could get anything we wanted and she was very stern with the
And uh my mother eventually told us you know Well she has this thing uh and you know just really and part of it has to do with her family and the fact that people you know uh when her sister tried to you know pass for white and thought she was better than everybody else and she kind of she thinks people who tried to pass for white think they're better than everybody else and light people think they're better than everybody else And the fact is she was light And that was the thing that was the thing that was so funn
And it was like she was rejecting who she was in some ways by you know the way she treated you know the other grandchildre
Um but you know there were just lot of mixed feelings involved and she had to deal with her feelings in her own but when got older when got to be an adult actually talked to her about i
told her Granny you know you are so sweet to us but you are wrong about this you shouldn't be treating people differently because of that What did she say And she said at first Did she really kind of know she was doing it Yes she di
Um and she said she said she said Baby she said You don't understand about life the way understand about life But as she got older um she never acknowledged that she was wrong but she did change her behavio
So Now this was the one who married at 16 and didn't Yeah yeah married my grandfather who who she was light and he was dark and don't know whether that was the reason she married him although it was kind of like one of those arranged marriages A
Where he was he was minister's son so he had they had property and stuff and they were very wellconnected in the community and very held in high estee
His father was like uh the guy who had been pastor of this big church for long period of time and and and so think her family the Tates really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason and so they just really just told her she was going to be marrying hi
She didn't even understand the marriage ceremony she didn't even know that she had gotten married really Wow And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy she said Go home with him He's old enough to be my daddy Well he was almost old enough to be her dadd
My sister keeps telling me she says Sometimes you're just like Granny you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons And did because thought he treated thought he treated uh my mother and some of the siblings not well in the family because he had pets and that all sort of thing not based on color of skin or anything but just based on don't know on whatever anywa
My my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and ah so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn't work in the field
But they were divided about like who were the field hands and who were the house kids it was kind of Really Yeah it was almost like plantation system That's interestin
Yeah it was operating within the family He would have been born He was born in 1880 something like 188 think it was 1889 think it was when he was bor
No it was no he was older than that because my grandmother was born in 1900 and he was born 16 years earlier 1884 1884 yea
But he was you know in lot of ways just like plantation owner's son because he was the son of this guy who owned lot of propert
And he was philanderer an oh yeah he was like out there And ah so you know didn't like him but anyway those are my storie
The story shall talk about today is about my father and the culture diversities he had when he moved to Americ
He is from Greece and he is from small village in Greece called Tokalleka and he came to America and believe it was 1969 or 1970 and he shortly got marrie
Uh the problem he had with coming to America guess was was that uh he uh he wanted to still have the village aspects where he wanted to the farm and all those stuff living in suburb in Mallard Creek are
And this was probably about uh 20 years ago or maybe 15 years ago when the area was not so guess rich as it is no
Um he gathered all these animals goats horse chickens and goat and he just had so many animals And the problem was that animals didn't like to stay at the house they wanted to go around to other people's houses you know eat their flowers and stuff and plant
We lived off um 85 in Mallard Creek where currently the 485 is now cause then the like last ten years we had to move because of the 48
lot of times they would get their horns and stuff caught into the um fences because there were square fences that my father himself put up all around the property but they would get their horns and stuff and they would jump over the fence very easily so they would be on the side of the highway and at least or times that can remember the police would have to come and say you know You have to get your animals And our father always told us not to say they are animal
So and thought this was really crazy because who else in the neighborhood had goats and chickens and stuff and so but he was convinced that they could not prove that those were our goats so but it was very embarrassing as child living in Mallard Creek because people everybody knew when you rode school bus um we didn't have the yard with the flowers and stuf
We had the goats out there and often our animals would get loose and we had to go out and follow our cow home or something like that or the um animal control would come out to like subdue cow if it would get too far away so that's really the story have today um it was just really awkward experience with him and his animal
Other thing that he did with animals was in Greece in his culture goat is really an important meat; kind of delicacy and he even ended up selling goats from this suburb area and the Greek people would come out pick out their goat which was really sad for my brother and because we as children you know goats were our friends and pets stuff and they would come out and pick out their goat and then they would proceed to kill it on property and it was really horrible for us as children it was traumatizin
To see your little pet or friend you know have to be killed skinned and then they would cut it up and put out their parts there and then they would go off to their restaurant to their dinner or wedding or whatever and eat the goa
When DOT took his property we moved to smaller smaller area in Concord where you are not allowed to have animals because it's zoned and so that's the end of the animal stor
Today he is going to talk to us about the Third SS the U2 Quick and the Blackbir
That's kind of unique in that I uh spent uh about 16 years of my career in Special Activitie
Way back in uh 19 and 60 19 and 52 when returned from the uh Korea was assigned to uh unit which was called C124 Third Strategic Support Squadron and uh one of their primary purposes was to uh uh move atomic weapons to forward location
And uh one of my jobs at the time was training individuals how to put parachutes on nuclear weapons trigger to uh which detonates the atomic bomb itsel
But my job was to put parachutes on it and life preservers when we would load it and start to an overseas locatio
would uh put parachutes on the trigger itself and we use that if in case we had to throw the trigger out over land when we was approaching water we had to put four life preservers on what they call Mae West on the trigger so we just threw it out over wate
That was the primary thing we wanted to save since there wasn't any way to dump 20megaton Hbomb off 30 C12
If you started to run it back to the elevator why it would turn the aircraft upside down so it would if we had trouble the the bomb itself would end with the aircraft of cours
The rest of us after uh after we got the trigger out why we uh would bale out of the aircraft regardless whether if it was water over land air or what but the bottom did go i
want to say that there wasn't any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode regardless of how hard it hit the groun
Even if the aircraft was on fire why it it would uh burn and it would melt through lead component for the radiation to leak ou
But anyway uh had top secret clearance in that so in 19 and 57 why uh they started uh didn't know why they was running the clearance on me to begin because thought uh top secret was the highest you could go in security clearance and of course that knew everybody in my neighborhood was asking me Well what if they're asking about you And even uh uh neighbor in Earl NC told me that they was checking with him on why uh uh on why uh they was running clearance on m
didn't know anything about it until about the time well uh knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when had top secret so didn't know anything about what it was all about until arrive
got orders to go to Del Rio TX so when arrived out there well found out had to go to Laughlin Air Force Bas
was reporting to certain place in Del Rio then had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base which had just reopene
Anyway it was pretty soon after arrived there there was some RV57 arrived which used crasher suits as high altitude photography plane well figured that's what it wa
had already been to partial pressure suit school in my career field where was  so started training with equipment had never handled befor
didn't know what it was all about or anything till had to go out and train hook in in RV57D which say now found it it was forerunner to your U2 aircraf
Well they looked like two big gliders flying over the base and they made circle and come in and landed and didn't know whether it was glider or what it was hadn't heard the name U2 when first arrive
Come to find out it was U2 aircraft but we couldn't we could not say one word about what it was; nothing to our wives kids or anybod
OK well started the training in the U2 with the pressure suits and everything and uh don't know how long it was suited and unsuited the pilots and just practiced putting them in the aircraf
Well it got to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in week and didn't know where they're flying t
All we done they never did tell us any place where they was going even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for whil
It's 30 or 40 U2 aircraft and we'd started the training Chinese pilots British pilots in them just all over the the world that we were allies wit
Uh but one of the things that am proud of in the U2's was the life support man u
Of course parachutes and life rafts packed the survival kits but the U2 kits had what they call F124 hundred regulator in them which was highly cued regulator to give the pilots breathing pressure and counter pressure in their capstans of the partial pressure suits in case they had decompression at high altitudes like 60 80 thousand fee
You know you can't you cannot survive if you don't have any counter pressure increase breathing pressure in those altitude
If if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit your hands would go to about five times the size if you had decompressio
So uh skip lot of things here that could say but they chose me and one more gu
That was the only 922 which was life support man the other man was physiological suppor
Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers and brings him back dow
They have to go through number of altitude chambers uh rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suit
Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done well had to go through altitude chambers myself because was working with pressure suit
went to Fort Worth TX to go through the altitude chambers with partial pressure just like was working with and when when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things was chosen with sergeant secretary to go through school which we was in school about the size of nicesize bathroo
Michael Santo of of Firewell and Company of Buffalo NY they was the one that uh manufactured uh invented the high O2 regulator before that they built fire control on the stove wel
Well Mike Santo would start training us in this small room with F24 hundred regulator with we had to tear it down and break it break it down so many times and uh we had to uh set injections on i
It's little screw which set an injection but the the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressur
Each pilot has different breathing capacity and we would have to uh uh bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh uh I'd have to have to set it for uh second or which was going through schoo
Then he'd dress me and uh he'd set the injection on me and you uh uh we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could and you better if uh the the the top portion of your helmet surged which you had rubber around the neck and the visor close
And uh if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish' and like it was going to pull your head of
You'd better get the little screw turned down little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easil
And well anyway needless to say had to tear down the regulator and put it back together blindfol
never did see and don't know yet why unless it was just ex ex expressing the the the need to know what you was doing and whateve
The part was there was 158 parts to it and we had to break it down put it back together break it down and never make mistak
Well had taken me about 45 days  and I both to get through the school and my wife will tell you today that turned grayheaded within those 45 days and not real gray but did turn gray heade
would think Well I'm I'm going to let somebody else go but then would think My God They've they chosen me over about 15 individuals there to go to through that school and I'm not I'm no
So would go back determined determined to stay with it and of course they trained two more after had been through but who did they use to set all the injections And it was myself and Secretary the one who went through that school that you know the two that we wen
One more thing uh while we were in the school and Mike Santo was teaching us we could uh take notes but before we left out of the room Mike would take and tear every one of the notes up that we had and get it down to where you'd rub pencil over it where you could not rea
He would tear the the paper up and put it in the sand ashtray sand set it on fire and burn it and then stir the ashes up like tha
About uh less than two months after uh uh we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months Firewell and Company come up with an automatic foolproof uh uh that uh the regulator adjusted itself with little valve that moved back and fort
It would not burst the lungs it would not over inflate it it was so perfect that you needn't even have to open the kit to set the injectio
They chose me over everybody else and of course Sergeant Secretary he was different AFC but he's the one that went through school with they chose me to go out of the uh uh the organization that was at on the presen
Now it's on the same base but they've set taken me to field maintenance to run regulators in the altitude chamber
You had to run them every so often every 60 days believe it was had to make sure that they was uh reading exact pressure like at uh eight or 20000 feet 30000 40 50 60 70000 feet and you had to record i
If it was off one iota you had to do some adjusting to the regulator itsel
And thought that was privilege and it's still it's still was the only nine twotwo ExO which was my AFFC Air Force Career fiel
Uh was still the one and only nine twotwo that had ever set the injection on the regulato
was the only one that uh ever run the regulators for the the test in the miniature altitude chamber
So anyway worked with the 4080th until 19 and 60 late 1962 well 1963 before left the 4080th and have some things her
Uh well of course you know  was shot down over Russia in 19 and 60 and then we come with the Cuban Crisi
It was from airbase that flew over Cuba and of course Rudolph Anderson was shot dow
He was the only casualty of the Cuban Crisis and uh Kaiser uh he got the pictures and flew straight to Andrews Air Force in Washingto
And uh Adlai Stevenson which was United Nation's uh uh Ambassador to US US he sit and told Androv Gromikov of Russia that he would sit there until hell froze over unless he had admitted to having the missiles installed in Cuba; offensive missiles headed for the United States targeted for the United State
And of course Androv Gromikov didn't answer anything but we had all the information from the films the U2 had take
Well the next day of course President Kennedy uh blockaded Cuba and uh our ships stopped Russian ship that was headed just outside of Cuba within and they found missiles on the
If they would have kept moving with that ship towards Cuba it's my understanding that uh we come within six minutes of nuclear war because President Kennedy would have launched the missiles uh on Russi
But anyway Nikita Khrushchev backed down turned all of his ships around and headed back to Russi
Now uh uh worked with life support had to stay there and keep extra gear extra pressure suits extra kits extra parachuteseverything that if had to in an emergency that would we'd send these this equipment out to one of those attachments and and that's what di
And of course uh this is an outstanding job that uh General that uh he was colonel at that time gave me an award for doing that outstanding job and also this is the same Colonel Colonel that uh with President Kennedy giving our unit the outstanding unit award and until today I've got it all here in the in the papers that until today the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the U2's that was in at that time is the highest uh unit in peace time there ar
Uh of course won't go but we have just so much could talk about but uh that is the main things that we of course everybody knows now that the what has happene
Uh Russia backed down and that's the good thing to do because if they did not and we went to nuclear war was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC but it happened so fast didn't get them bac
Because if their was nuclear war then or if there's nuclear bombs started missiles or anything would want the first one to hit me right between the running lights because this just would be world after nuclear war an
So well I uh anyway uh uh this is the three uh U2 pilots that uh President Kennedy's office in Washington with General Ma
President Kennedy says to the pilots says Gentlemen you take good pictures This is the one that went over Cuba and got the pictures they showed in the United Nations and of Rudolph Anderson was shot down uh during the fligh
And and we were uh the 48th Extension Reconnaissance Wing this was after the Cuban crisis was voted by the TX legislature that all the members of the 48th Extension Reconnaissance Wing was uh the TX Ambassador
This was the first time that that had happened in 75 years that TX legislature had voted military unit being TX Ambassadors so needed TX Ambassador
didn't know what was going for or anything so was to report to designated place in Washingto
and didn't go directly to uh that uh they had told me to on my order
went to my sister's that lived there Her husband was in the service and worked with Intelligence and went to their hous
So went to her house and then called in to this number was supposed to call when got ther
They asked few questions and answered them and they said Get your baggage and leave there immediately and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address was supposed t
Well they they live there and I uh needed place to stay They said We're paying for place for you to sta
You don't have to stay there Well after they checked they asked me about her husban
After they checked found out he was in security service with the Air Force they said OK could go ahead back and stay there if wanted and they gave me certain time to report to the CIA Headquarters which can say that name and needless to say was up there for week and I can't say anything else what happened or anythin
Of course came back after week to Laughlin Air Force base and then shortly thereafter got orders could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas NV and couldn't tell my wife or anything about why was going there because didn't kno
And so we moved to Las Vegas NV and reported just like did in Washington to certain address in downtown Las Vega
They told me that uh that would be called in guy at the end for me to mee
It was another GI and said would go with him on Monday morning to certain location and we never was for many many years we could not even mention the location but now have the declassification of it Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized and it tells all about the A12 Blackbird crew that was going to in early 1963 and guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when got out and gone out found out what was going into and looked at one of those birds there was actually bile come into my mout
We had full pressure suits there in the aircraft just just like the astronauts wore except ours was totally silver silver uh boot and everything to reflect heat of cours
started immediately uh uh training into that from the other two guys that was at the locatio
They had already had their training in the full pressure suits and it taken me while if you go into full pressure suit
Different totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies uh three times the speed of sound over 22000 miles an hou
You can't even imagine that and really can't get over as as many pilots that put in that aircraft and know and seen them come in and go walk up the plank to to get him out of the aircraft and he waits for me to get him ou
When pull when he pulls the canopy for me to start getting him out he points to two instruments on the left side of the aircraft that had actually melted during the fligh
And one of our jobs was to measure uh heat on the top of their helmet which was piece to tape that went across there and put out by NASA that uh there was different spots of paint on i
And the spots of paint would change every hundred degrees it might be red it change to blu
Where didn't know what the code was but of course I'd take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but know that have measured them and they told me he had 300 degrees on the top of his hea
But you have to remember he had tremendous cooling system going in to his full pressure suit and going out to the inside of his hands channels and then down to his feet he's got channels pumping cold air down there all the time and then comes back and exhausts out the outside of the contro
You're putting man in there it's risking his life those tests like what we had Lockheed Aircraft individual
Test pilots that flew them first like Lou  could name all of them really but they test the birds first and then our CIA pilots started flying the
We were the ones handled our CIA pilots uh anyway uh we set all kinds of records step by ste
But we only lost one CIA pilot there and really why uh there's modification that we shouldn't have mad
In the meantime the Air Force bought the SR71 now the A12 that we were working with the CI
It was one space aircraft oneman aircraft he operated all the cameras and everything and flew the aircraf
The SR71 was two space aircraft which you had pilot and systems operator in the back seat give the pilot little bit of break from what the A12 CIA version of the plane ha
Anyway we deployed and can tell now be because of this that that that uh we deployed to Kadina Okinawa and this was in 196
Weeks had his name here on page six and he made the flight over up to the edge of China over North Korea extreme north back over the middle and back down sout
Got the pictures of the Pueblo when the North Koreans captured the Pueblo and brought it in to North Kore
Well we got the pictures of that and and even got the pictures of Russian officer walking on the gangplan
Why remember it so is that was the individual that put MrWeeks in the aircraft and and sent him out on his mission and made successful missio
And uh one bad thing though coming back down below South Korea between there and Japan our battleships launched their vehicles and started firin
And of course they were going so fast they couldn't move up and down but evidently they got uh word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler button on the inside of the aircraf
don't know that; never was told that but CIA got the word quick like that but they never could shoot him down anyway and they have never neve
And uh course won't go into anything else because I'm not prepared with my information here but thank you very muc
This story it's uh it's happened about two years ago and uh uh my wife Elizabeth have son Jack who's ten years old son Nick who's eight and uh Alex who's fiv
And we're trying to make decision whether to buy beach place beach house or lake house or mountain hous
And we'd read this newspaper on Sunday morning you know you get these articles about um you know advertisements about these beautiful mountain mountain lake places and we thought Gosh this is great you know it's combination of both it's a it's a mountain place with this beautiful lake that surrounds this this mountain So um we called and uh this guy answered the phone and he's with the development company it's up in the mountains it's near uh uh Lake Lur
And uh the guy says Come on up and he says Wha what will you be driving and uh we said Well a car or van you know Do you is the van fourwheel drive and said Well no it's not and he says Well you know some of this gets real rugged you know up here and uh it's not fully developed the you know you can look at some of the lots if you bring your van you can just look at some of the lots that are developed you know so it'll be you can drive right up to it So um we thought about that and we thought Well let's just take the truck because have fourwheel drive truck it's got the king cab and we put all the kids in the back smashed them in that little king cab part and got in the truck and drov
And we drove about two hours and it was getting pretty hot you know kind of kind of miserable ride and we get up and uh get up to Lake Lure into this development pull into the development; you have to drive like meandering through this this hillside and we get up to this trailer and uh we thought Well this is you know we thought Well we'd be able to see houses and uh you know you could tell this development was not that far alon
So we talked to the development guy and he he kind of shows us map real rough map of the area and uh so tells us Well you know here here are the key key kind of sites and you're looking for what And we said Well we want a house that's kind of in the mountains and that looks on lake like you had in the newspaper And he goes Well we got we got SOME of those and said Well in the newspaper it says you have all your houses are overlooking lakes and he goes Well you know and he could tell we had driven long way just to you know you know just to see some really kind of rugged area and we he knew exactly what we wanted at that poin
He says Well here's there's one lot left that actually overlooks this water and it's on hilltop and uh you know kind of drew it out on this paper map and then we drove out ther
Well we start driving in this truck you know have fairly large truck and we're driving and the road's at first paved and then we're driving along and then it goes to stone gravel and then pretty much we keep going and it's like dirt turns into dirt road and then at the end of this road probably the last twenty minutes we're driving over tree stumps to get to this location on this ma
It took us twenty minutes of rough driving in fourwheel drive to get to the top of this hil
And we get get there and we literally had to park between trees that they'd just cu
And uh they'd just clearcut; don't know if you know ever heard what clear cutting i
Clear cutting is you cut the trees down but you leave the trees there then you bring bulldozer and push them off late
Well they hadn't pushed any of these off so there's these trees on top of this hil
And kind of drove to the peak of this hill and we could see down on the lake and it was kind of neat but the the the lake the hill the grade down to the lake was just unbelievable it was almost like clif
And you know you could it was probably an eight per cent grade very steep grad
So Elizabeth Like what degree More than for less than fortyfive degrees mean It was about uh probably thirty degrees so pretty stee
And Elizabeth ah immediately she looks at me and she goes You keep these boys here you know we'll stay and we'll kind of look around but you know um just you keep track of these guys Well Alex the youngest of course he's just so sick of being in this truck he says Get me out of here you know just Let me out say OK everybody we're going to get out of the truck we're going to kind of look around we'll do some stuff and then we'll probably eat breakfast and then we'll go or ea we had our little bag lunches and then we'll go down to the lak
And uh we get out of the truck and we walk about ten feet and I was like walking over logs and trying to get over to fairly clear area and all of sudden Alex just goes Snake Snake screaming at the top of his lungs you know and it it just it was unbelievable how loud he was yelling how and thought Oh my God he got bit by snake Well turn around and go Wha what's wrong  and Alex is pointing at me and look down between my legs and there's this rattlesnake like I'd stepped in this rattlesnake nest And I'm standing there and go OK everybody just calm down and you kno
And stepped down on the log and then Ja Alex is freaking out just freaking out he's going Jees Dad Jees you know my go my son's cussing like do you know was so scared So we walk we walk away from that snake go Oh my God I'm lucky I'm not dead you know they could have bit me and then you guys would have put me in truck and hauled me twenty minutes and I I you know probably would have died And I I'm like God somebody's trying to tell me somethin
So anyway we kind of we stayed away from the snake and we're kind of walking around and then Jack and Nick they Jack's the oldest and Nick you know is eight and uh they want to go down to the lake and Elizabeth's going No don't let them go down to the lake just it's too steep don't let them go down to the lake And uh we you know they're just saying Well what are we doing We're just going to get in the truck and then go back Let's just at least look at the lake So said OK guy
You guys can go go down to the lake just be careful And uh so they kind of walked over to the hill kind of started walking down and at point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down and the trees were all cut so they'd grab trees as they were going dow
And um was just watching them and was up at the top and then started down I'd figured let them go first then I'd I'd go kind of behind the
And Alex was with Elizabeth And Alice Alex stayed with Elizabeth and she was mad at us because we were doing thi
And um said Nick everything OK you know he says Yeah yeah All of sudden Nick and we still to this day do not know why he did this he stood up on this grade and started running down this hil
mean the hill's no human being could catch that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down and he starts running and he's running and you could just see it was like there's no way he's going to recover from thi
And he's running trying to keep up with gravity so he's going down this hill and literally falling down the hill but instead of falling down he's running And what we didn't know was this hill came down and then there was twenty foot cliff with big terrace in it and then the hill kept goin
They'd cut terrace into the hill halfway down it you couldn't see it from the top where they drove trucks down and they'd just clear cut this and down at that cliff the bottom of that cliff was twenty foot in the air literally higher than this ceiling and down at the bottom were just these little like bungee where they'd cut all this brush and there's little bungee stuff sticking ou
And all of sudden just saw Nick just run and disappear off this cliff and he's just flying like the last thing saw was him flyin
go Oh my God By that time I'm running down the hill just grabbing stuff like falling down the hill grabbing stuf
And as saw he hit the ground flat like on those bungees and then flipped two time
He hit flat face first flipped three times mean end over end and landed in the spread eagle backwards and by the time came down the cliff he's just grabbing his eyes and looked down and then saw those bungees and thought Oh my God he impaled his eyes and his face and his body with these bungee things uh oh my God just flew off the cliff you know and by that time get to him he's just he's not even breathing and looked at him go Nick Are you all right And looked at his nose and his mouth and his eyelids and what he'd done he'd hit the ground and it was real dusty powder
He'd missed all those bungee sticks but the dust and dirt had gone in his mouth and like his nose was filled with dirt it backed up in here and under his eyelids were filled with dirt he was he goes he looked at me and he goes Uuuugggghhhh He couldn't tal
He says Am alive Am alive go Nick what were you doing What did you think Wha why what were you thinking to run down this hill And he goes Well started falling and couldn't stop myself and figured I'd rather run down hill as fast as could and thought that could could outrun it and saw Bugs Bunny do it on T on cartoons He thought Bugs Bunny could outrun you know the speeding locomotive or and it think his whole mind you know like when the house is falling and Bugs Bunny hops out at the last minute and then lives That's what he was thinking that's that's science that's kinetic energy in his min
Bottom line we got him back up the hill and one week later we bought house at the beac
Snakes killing our kids you know two hours it's hot; it was the most miserable tim
And Elizabeth and still to this day say We didn't we're lucky that we that two of us aren't dead you know from trying to buy the mountain house But that's my stor
Thanksgiving was hanging out with my friends on Friday night OK to give you little backgroun
You know we just went to the movies or whatever and then the next night went to wor
Which you know when you get fever you don't realize you have fever at the time especially when you're that age because you don't know exactly what the symptoms ar
So go into the doctor's office you know back in high school days thought it was cool had the black leather jacket and all tha
Uh so he asked what drugs I'm on you know what had OD'd on Nothing nothin
So he examines me and all that sends me home with my mother and he had given her instructions on what to do if anything happened to m
I lying in bed passed out while was lying in bed fell out of bed or somethin
So did the doctor know what was wrong with you He had an idea what was wrong with me but he didn't want to tell my parents because he didn't want to get them in total pani
So they take me to the hospital and bang my head couple of times on the way ther
My sister told me that at the time that let out huge scream which don't remembe
And remember while my mother was driving me around every time she would hit bump you know that was like the mallet would ah increase the pain level about four time
You know all these things my parents had to call my school and everything and tell them was in the hospital practically dyin
So it was actually lot worse experience for my family because you know they had You were passed out half the tim
Right they had to go through wondering for three days whether or not was going to liv
For couple of days maybe not three days for like a guess maybe like 24hour period or what eve
Oh really like permanent stuff could happen Because meningitis effects your uh the lining of your nervous syste
And your brain which is called the meningitis it gets swollen and that is what caused the pai
Now where were you working in the beginning when you started washing the dishes in restaurant In nursing hom
In 1992 my sister the same sister that drove me to the hospital when had meningitis with my father she got cancer in 1992 in 1991 in April of 1991 she was diagnosed week after my niece was bor
And what they figured out was that it was tumor so the tumor was pressing against nerve which made her arm num
So as soon as diagnosed it did they pretty much say that there was not much we can do because it is all over her bod
She never had that idea in her mind mean like right up to month or two before she uh passed away she was doing math homework was helping her with math homewor
She never gave up and you know she went through all the treatments and then well then funny thing relates to that story like well then the whole story is not funn
But we had the two or three weeks before we wound up going to the hospital lot we knew her time was shor
And then every time wound up driving into Manhattan you know we lived on Staten Island so was driving into Manhattan and every time would park on the street would get parking ticke
should have just parked in the parking garage but the parking garages were like anywhere from $14 to $24 da
How much is parking ticket Well think that parking ticket at the time was maybe $25 or something like tha
Yeah this is how efficient the people were that were giving the tickets out were uh so that was fu
How was it on the family to see just to know that the end is nea
mean because you all live there together in the same basic area right Right we all most of us live on Staten Islan
She was living at the same place at the time uh you know it was sad of course it was also you know it was binding experience my family did become closer after that you know because you know united in tragedy guess you could sa
Did different people tend to handle it differently How Oh yes definitely wide range of reactions you kno
You know you know one of my brothers was real upset you know ah most of us were pretty mellow like you know we weren't really at the time we weren't really outwardly trying you know we really didn't show lot of upsetnes
How long mean did the doctor just come and say she has got about six weeks left or one of those kinds of things did did you know JG Yes ye
Well they said in April they said that she had she had about three months which would be like July towards the end of July thin
But it uh turns out she died right in the middle of June so she actually died before the time that they gave he
He is living in Manhattan now with my two nieces you know my family is still very close to the
You know consider him you know just as close as any of any of my other relative
year and two months old so she really didn't no she never really go that close to he
Another funny story was related to that my other niece the older niece she was three at the time she still had her pacifier and everythin
But uh she would wake up at night sometimes going Mimi Mimi Mimi Now is that Mom No she had pacifier she called ah Mimi So her pacifier would fall out of her mouth at night so she would just wake u
It would be right next to her she wouldn't just grab it stick it in her mouth she would go Mimi Mimi So had to get up put the pacifier in her mouth it was really cut
But don't know if it totally hit her you know what mean If she had been about five or six it probably would have been very differen
But she would go through stages where she would be upset you know like she would realize mean she realized what happened and of course now she is really awar
But at the time guess you know guess she would forget you know and sometimes she would remembe
remember when was probably around nine ten eleven somewhere in there we used to play outside lo
We had groups of us that would get together and play kickball every night until it got dark so dark that we couldn't see and then we rode our bike
And back then it was colder in the Charlotte area than it is now and we would have snow at least once or twice year and it wasn't unusual to get foot of sno
And we all had ice skates so we would ice skate up and down the streets; remember doing tha
We missed at least two weeks of school every year for snow and we always had heavy coats and mittens stuff that you don't have now her
And every weekend we would have hockey games and during the day they would you know redo the ice and then you could ice skat
And was afraid and couldn't come down and so my daddy had to get this really high ladder and come up it and get me dow
Been there done that Um let's see there was uh obviously no VCRs or any of tha
And remember when color TV came out and was so excited My parents finally bought color television and the first thing that we watched in color was Bonanz
And remember running around outside being really really hot thinking Bonanza would come on at 900 on Sunday
And we'd come running back in the house to watch it and we'd be all hot and sweaty and dirty and mother would make us sit on the floor and we'd sit there watching Bonanz
And let's see and the other thing that remember that was my favorite movie was The Wizard of O
The only theatres that was in Charlotte was the Manor Theatre on Providence Road and what was called the Carolina Theatre up tow
Um we would ride the buses; big treat was to ride the bus uptown to go shopping at Ivy's and Belk'
And for Christmas they had these elaborate window displays and we would ride the buses uptown on the weekend to look at all the and walk all through uptown to look at the window displays with all the Christmas decoration
When was your age worked uptown and um there was only two big buildings First Union building and the Wachovia building and all the rest of it were parking lot
can't think of anything else to talk about We didn't um in Charlotte back in the 50s and 60s they didn't have the big orange school buses and we either walked to school because everything was neighborhood schools so in elementary school we always walked to schoo
And the first time ever went to Myrtle Beach was 14 years old and it was we went with friends of min
And we would go up and down the main drag there at Myrtle Beach where the Pavilion is and we would thumb up and down the and we would just hop in the car with guys and ride up and down and yell and wave to everybody and then we'd get tired of those guys and we'd hop and go hop out and hop in the car with some more guy
It was totally safe You never worried about it Um then all the hippie stuff started in the 60s and that was during Vietna
When was in uh junior high and high school there was big letter writing campaign to all the soldiers in Vietnam lot of the guys was in high school with got drafte
Uh hmm I'm running out of things to say again was dating guy that lived in the apartment beside Stev
And Steve would see me going up there to visit him or see us going out and stuf
And then um neighbor that lived across the street from me her husband was member of the Jump Club; Steve was jumping then and she had cookout one night invited some people over and went over there and um think was the youngest one ther
They were all going out to club or something and wasn't old enough to get in but went with the rest of the
think was kind of at the end of the line and snuck in anyway and Steve thought was really cut
And then one of my girlfriends that was living with me at the time we worked together at First Union she bet me that couldn't date different guy every day for weeks so did tha
used to be cute Um anyway Steve and dated guess not quite year about nine months or so and then we decided to get married and then he took it back and then we decided to get married and then he took it back and then we decided to get married and then he took it back again What else Hmm Ask me questio
There were no there were only two night clubs in Charlotte so if you wanted to go out like to listen to music and dance there was only two places to g
Like every weekend there would be parties in the clubhouses of the apartment complexes and that was pretty much where you would go to dance and just hang out with your friend
Um things escape me Oh When was in high school the big excitement was cruising Shoney'
There were four Shoney's in Charlotte and you would ride from one it was like big circle and you would ride from one to the other and everybody would hang out there because it was drivein then so all the cars were parked outsid
And you could cruise through to see who was there and if it wasn't any cute guys there or anybody you liked then you would cruise to the next on
They were spread out around town so it would take about an hour to drive between all of the
And that was the big thing for all the guys was to steal the Shoney's Big Boy and try to get it on top of their car and go riding down the road with it on top of the ca
Um once when was in high school spent the night with my girlfriend across the street and we snuck out and pushed her mother's brand new Camero out of the driveway and halfway down the road then we started i
And then we went cruising and we had an egg fight with some other guys riding down Independence Blv
We were leaning out the windows throwing eggs at each other and everywhere the eggs hit it knocked the paint off her mother's brand new ca
All my family's in eastern North Carolina so we went there several times year to my grandmother's and aunts' and uncles
We this was at the beach and we'd go to the beach during the day and the movies or stuff at nigh
The most traumatic thing my daddy decided to build house when was in the 10th grade so and he literally built the house and when we moved into it there was no sheet rock on the inside and the plumbing wasn't hooked up ye
So we had garden hose coming in through the kitchen window for our water in the sink in the kitche
We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasn't any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs nailed those to the studs for privac
And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the hous
So we had weekend when it was like 12 of us staying there with one toilet the hose going in through the kitchen and piles of dirt and then the porch wasn't finished and we had boards going up to the porch so you had to walk up the boards to get i
So had my dates pick me up at somebody else's house because was embarrassed for them to come my hous
Well did you and Linda ever play together My sister and didn't like each other growing up; we fought all the tim
She was my bratty little kid sister that got in the way and tattled on m
remember when we were both teenagers she would sneak in and take my clothes and we would fight over tha
Daddy worked for Douglas Aircraft and then they closed up and they didn't want to move so they stayed here and he had it took him while before he found job
He had that on the porch of the house and used to sit out there and help him load shotgun shells and we used to go target shooting and stuf
When was in junior high school the big thing was um alpaca sweaters Aline skirts and Pappagalo shoe
So that all could afford to do was get the shoes and the sweaters and made all my skirts and made my blouse
And the first time ever we we camped we would go to the mountains and go camping that was the only thing we did as far as vacatio
So when she got home was responsible for doing the cooking and having all that done when she got home from wor
We just didn't the big thing was to go to place called Dino's Pizzas and get pizz
Ah OK Tom I'll be asking you some questions and this will be the first on
What stories do you remember family members telling you when you were child Ha How about ghost story Oh When person dies in my family they're supposed to visit all the relatives that are aliv
Do you remember usually in what places she used to tell you Like at home or special occasions N
But but as recall never asked her if she'd ever had a maybe she did she did tell me that someone got on the end of her bed when she was kid and it was departed family membe
It kind of it scared her but at the same time she knew whoever it was had uh passed awa
And and do you remember your house How it looked How it was When was kid Oh sure very muc
And your grandma was in New Jersey too Yeah she was in New Jersey and she had house that was not far from our house and it was just little old house and you know my mother my parents my mother grew up there my uncles my aunt
They had grape arbor where the grapes grow and my mother to this day hates having grape
What about stories from your parents From your father From my father He talks about being in the Depression and they were very poor and they had to get coa
They had to uh heat their house and there was place where the trains had to slow down on this hill as they climbed with with coal going to New York City and the kids would get on this train with big sacks big heavy sacks called burlap sacks and they would steal coal from the train put it in these big bags throw the bags off jump off before the train got rolling fast again to go down the hil
Do you remember how old your father was He said uh you know ten years old you know nine just youn
What about your mom My mom talks uh tells stories about picking tomatoes and she used to pick beans and tomatoes for nickel bushel and bushel is big basket and they would she'd work all da
Maybe it was no think it was nickel picking these beans and they got nickel for i
What about reading Do you remember something about reading remember my grandmother who was Welsh trying to teach me Welsh and she would sing nursery songs to me and tell me little poems in Wels
It's got clicks and it just doesn't sound like anything that is even that we are even familiar wit
This is stuff that's totally whoo over the mountain and people just Welsh is dead languag
Like orrorrrrr kind of like rorrrroruh click and she'd click and say funny things with the clicking soun
The clicking was fascinating how she can talk and click at the same time was fascinating and then she wore dentures too and that made it even more fantasti
But um favorite books when you were child My favorite books Oh always liked KonTiki by Thor Heyerdahl and he was man who was in the South Pacific and he demonstrated that the Polynesians could weave basket boats together and travel all around the Pacific with these boats and to me that was fab fabulou
My name is Barbara Goodroe and the accent you hear is Georgian where was raised even though was born in Tampa FL in 193
was an elevenyearold when um the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and remember very clearly um the day that walked out of church my Sunday School class and walked into the church big open atrium there and large church in Columbus GA and saw grown men slapping their fist clenched fist in the palms of their hands and remember clearly the jaws that were clenched and the anger that was there in their face
And of course all the juniors which was in the junior department started saying What's happened What's happened And then they said that America had been attacke
Pearl Harbor and many ships uh had been sunk and that many men many many men had been kille
Columbus GA is the home of Fort Benning GA where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there and as kid walking to school and believe it or not did walk four or five miles to school and would go up Brown Avenue which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come throug
And would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would uh ride by in the backs of trucks and would wave at them and it was not sexual thing in those day
It was just friendly thing that these were young men that were going off to war all of them most of them well all of them enlisted men or draftee
can remember one time specifically that um my dad we had two had three bedroom home with one bat
And people began to knock on our front door and asking if we had room to ren
And oh don't know how many don't just want to estimate four or five young couples would ring the doorbell and ask if we had room to rent and we would Ma or Dad would say n
And finally this one couple named Ed and Sally Duffind who came from Erie PA and they knocked on the door and he was lieutenant in the infantry and headed for German
And they said Well if you would just let us uh uh stay in your garage and my dad answered and said Well it has dirt floor And they said Well we don't care we don't mind tha
We'll just bring us some cots from the Army and we'll go to the uh service station which was several blocks awa
And Dad said Well uh no just can't imagine you staying in garage Said It's drafty and in the winter you would be cold and think it was the fall of the yea
And they looked so forlorn that my dad said Well come in and we'll talk about it So moved in at that juncture with my brothe
We moved the twin beds back there and moved his bed up in the front bedroom and for until that young couple the the husband went off to Germany we didn't know whether he'd ever see his wife again uh Sall
And uh he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Eri
In fact when he came back one time he gave me beautiful large pearl perfect pearl and years and years later when my father died in 1978 had took some of the money that got from his inheritance and uh bought heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possession
But can remember at that time that we'd go out to have uh we played softball and happened to be when was 12 years old was freshman in high schoo
In fact uh had skipped grade in grammar school is why was so young to go off to high schoo
Then have to admit that the grade skipped was kindergarten because was taller than the other kids and so that's we only had eleven grades in those days and so graduated when just turned 16 which was entirely too young but I'm getting ahead of myself little bi
We played softball at PE in high school and remember very clearly one day when was 12 somebody said uh There's an airplane and we all stoppe
The game stopped the PE stopped and we all looked up in the sky and tried to find where the airplane wa
And it just shows how much our nation has changed because there were so few airplanes falling passing over in the sky at that time that class at high school would stop and look for it to see if they could find i
Uh also remember other things that happened during that time of our country remember sitting at the feet of my the radi
We had nice sized one that sat on the floor and listening to President Roosevelt uh give his famous speech of day that will live in infamy and us sitting in total silence uh as the four members of our family listening to i
also remember one time uh Warm Springs GA was not very far from where lived and that's where President Roosevelt would come as uh uh when he had polio when he was young man thin
He moved he was making $25 week and remember as small child had my tonsils out of all things at four years old in dentist's offic
And mother saved five cents week and at the time that had my tonsils out she had saved $50 and that's what it cost to get them out at five dollars wee
But back again to the war years one time we came out of the doctor's office and was just standing on the corner and along came Roosevelt's famous car with no roof on it no top on i
don't remember whether he waved back or not so did get to see President Roosevelt himself and in person so that was big thrill for me as young perso
had mother's youngest brother Buster was sent to um the Pacific theater and he was in the Battle of Guadalcanal and all of the big he was in the infantry and in all of the big battles over there from island hoppin
And I one of the regrets that have in my life now that I'm almost 71 is the fact that threw away his mai
That was he just wrote beautiful letters and he was only about six years older than was maybe five years so corresponded with him and wrote him very faithfully couple of times week and wish had kept his letters because they were so graphic description
also had another young son of one of Mother's and Dad's friends that wrote gorgeous letters and beautiful letters and was in lot of the fighting in the Pacifi
Another experience that remember very clearly was riding on the train from we were going down to see my grandparents at Bradenton Palmetto FL actually below Tamp
And we would go down there and spend about month or six weeks every summer on train and we had to change trains in Jacksonville F
Dad would drive me to Albany drive us to Albany GA to catch the train and it would be full of enlisted men heading off to the wa
And sometimes they would be standing up in the train trying to get leave before they went overseas and there was child of maybe 11 or 12 years old and uh can remember very clearly the young man's face that taught me two or three new games of solitaire that still teach my grandchildren how to play now and still play myself sporadically and remember that tim
also remember how gracious they were and there was no cursing and no ugly language and they were very gracious to mother who was traveling with two childre
Years later when was mother myself and had two children decided would rego that route and actually caught train to Palmetto to see my grandparents who were dead then but to see my aunt and uncle and uh saw how hard it was for woman to travel on trai
And can remember that had one of the first boxes of disposal diapers and stood up in the train in the center of the train to go to the restroom and take Donna and change her diaper and she went to the bathroom and it all came down my dress and down her leg and puddled on the floo
We've been in Charlotte since August of 1998 and we came here to live uh near our second daughter and her husband who live here in Charlotte and have four grandchildre
Sunday morning we're picking up all our grandkids and we're all going out at 430 a
was in high school and one day was helping my father outside put window in replacing window on the garage doo
Well we was replacing this window and we got it fixed and my dad was like Let's go for little bike ride It was probably about 530 in the evening you know right before mom had supper ready so we went for quick bike rid
We got on the bikes and went down the road little piece and finally my dad said OK I'll race you back back to the uh house you wuss said All right So uh passed my dad passed him and about that time my brakes don't know what happened my front brakes got went in the spokes somehow and it it made me uh it flipped me in the air about one and half times and got we had toe clips on our bikes and finally finally my feet came out of my toe clips and my chin hit the pavement and Were you near your house Yeah kind o
But uh my chin hit the pavement and as soon as it hit felt felt something crack right here and just laid there on the road kind of shocked and my dad was like Kevin Kevin you know came up to me and was like uh Oh crap you know And he said few words and he didn't want to move me because he he saw the way fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move m
So am laying here in the middle of the road and he kept asking if am all right and was like Yeah I'm all right because knew something was wrong with me and hate hospitals and and don't want to go to hospital if something happens to m
But uh was like I'm all right Well he picked me up and put me on the side of the road and he raced back to the hous
Well they came and got me and took me back to the house and my mom I was shaking and stuff my mom was afraid was going in shock so she put blanket around me and she was like Kevin are you OK and was like Yeah I'm OK Mo
don't need to go to the hospital or anything like that am fine And she goes OK open your mouth for me So opened my mouth and couldn't get it couldn't shut it bac
She was like she was like OK you got to go to the hospital So started going nuts Well get to the hospital and they had to put me in this wheelchair and they rolled me in because couldn't wal
From the flipping Yeah and um rolled in there and they was like Oh man was you in bad car accident And because looked horrible mean my chin was bleeding because busted my chin and just looked bad and they my dad was like Nah he was in bicycle accident Just flipped his bik
So they took me to the hospital room and I'm going nuts people are having to hold me down while they pull as asphalt out of my chin Oh gros
And don't know never knew what was coming I I never knew what they did when you broke ja
Did they put you to sleep Nah well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the hospital and my mean my before went to bed my dad was like Well you got to go see specialist tomorrow and was like Wh what's he going to do and he was like Well he'll just tell you you're going to have to you know eat mashed potatoes and stuff the whole time soup and that's it and was like OK Well that night couldn't sleep at all because it felt like brick wall brick mean brick wall was on my head so much pressure was on my chin and stuff my ja

That was probably the most awkward two months of my whole life because I because had to drink all this stuff at schoo
couldn't eat regular food had to slurp it up with straw and I had uh was having to drink all these liquids and stuff at least every thirty minutes to an hour so wouldn't lose weigh
And you know people started doing the Kevin Talk What what was that It was like this you know everybody started when they would walk by me in the hall they would What's up Kevin Oh my God And it was called the Kevin Talk That's you Burns folk
And ever since then every time eat now my uh my left cheek starts to swea
It sweats It's got little circle where it sweats when eat because I it did nerve damage O
To my jaw and stuff there was nerve damage so sweat every time eat there just little circle of swea
And Avis has some stories that she'd like to um tell us regarding reading and um some experiences she's had with books and with teacher
Now Avis you had mentioned to me before about you had fifth grade teacher who you really enjoyed; who uh got you excited about readin
But did you have any other uh experiences with reading that brings back memories prior to fifth grade or did it really start with fifth grade Umm reading has always been passion for me and um that was probably one of my favorite Christmas presents growing u
My mom knew that if she got me new book was happy Umm so it didn't just begin in fifth grade but when you had um asked me about my favorite book Umhu
it took me back to fifth grade because that's when fell in love with my favorite boo
Well it's one of my favorite books now but then it was; it became my passio
What fav favorite book was that Do you remember Yes of course It was the dictionary Oh really Ye
just did report on the dictionary Really Well she part of the fifth grade teachers had pretty much required fiveword that you learn five words day 25 words wee
Agee was think was perceived by lot of the kids as tyrant but her um don't know exactly how to express it intensity regarding   That's good word  Um grammar and Englis
And you had to not only be able spell it and give definition for it but also had to be able to use it in sentenc
mean just and and therefore the dictionary itself became something that really mean if had to choose one book besides my Bible it would be the dictionary don't think could live without it That's amazing because most people when when they talk about their favorite book it's usually short story or novel that is pros
So that is really unusual I've never heard of somebody who had their favorite book as the dictionary O
How did you go about doing that Oh we had assignments where um we had to um write out the definition actually write out you know using the word in sentenc
And we had um spelling bee types of situations where we had to spell the wor
Everybody else was like Oh no Please not this And she gave you the 20 words Oh yes Uhhu
And then did you have to look them up yourself Absolutely So that's how your involvement got in with the dictionar
Well what about looking up words Why would that be an exciting thing for you Well um at heart I'm pretty much an adventurer and um as child uh stories were one way of exploring um for m
But um when don't know learn something new it just feeds something inside of me that uh don't know maybe my enthusiasm for life is just taken to another another leve
As an adult uh of course it has expanded into other areas but still um enjoy uh spending time with my friend the dictionar
Um one of the things that my husband teases me about is that when when have episodes during my chronic illness and have to be horizontal um sometimes I'll play Scrabble by mysel
And I'll play both sides and but don't play of course the way you would in competitio
But have my dictionary there so can say Ok now what You know this looks like it ought to be word let's see if there's anything So use it as learning experience and find out new thing
Interesting I've never heard of it solo That's really interesting When um when you went beyond the fif that was the fifth grade wasn't it When you went beyond fifth grade um did you continue on did the next teacher continue on that passion with vocabulary Um not reall
Um but when left fifth grade also left Brooklyn and when came to the VA school system things were very differen
Actually um there was sense in which think was little bit ahead of where folks were um in VA at that tim
Um where we were from in Brooklyn it was very multicultural environment and um it was very all the races were kind of accepted to certain degre
Um actually um didn't even have any kind of racial um prejudicialtype experience except for um from Blacks which Huh that's unusua
But um when we moved to VA and started to go to school here um the rejection got was because was Northerner and uh well not here because am in Charlotte now but ther
And uh they were very unhappy with the way spoke and um tended to stay to mysel
And um the teachers themselves didn't necessarily emphasize it it just became the library became my favorite plac
And if at all possible would get permission like to spend my lunch hours and to um spend my homeroom hours anytime could get to the library it was uh haven for m
In fact I um when got to high school which was in VA I um remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with 
And just reading each book and um just keeping on going until got to the end and um Boy that was real task wasn't it didn't consider it tas
It was wonderful mean would devour book day and my mom would say Honey take your nose out of that book and SOCIALIZE Talk to your brothers and sisters would read while ate I'd read on the bus would read while walked down the street if could get away with it So you were really absorbed in tha
And my mom had to really stay on me to be more well rounded um because it was very easy for me to escape into that because was um rejection was that was very hard to to deal wit
And one of the things that did attempted to do was to absorb the language around me and that was part of my my interes
mean al because we were always around so many different cultures always had an interest in language and an interest in culture
It was almost that was where it was like uh really got to see black and white divisio
But because didn't have problem with that there were those who had problem with me With you And so umm so it was very easy for me to withdraw from people into world of readin
Do you ever look back and and regret the fact that you spent all that time in those books Do you think in other words do you look at your experience as being negative one and it drew you into forced you into those books or did you think it was in some odd way more of good experience because you have absorbed your life in those books didn't consider it negative mean it was negative from the standpoint that that was being rejected in that respec
But the books having the opportunity it was fun to me It wasn't it you know as if say had been in situation where hadn't had the rejection and there was more accepted sociall
don't know that wouldn't have done the same thing But loved reading And whether it was by really liked true stories more than novel
And true life tends to be more fulfilling in reading to me than someone else's imaginatio
guess really I'm not guess there are very few things that find um where find that someone else's imagination intrigues me enough to for me to read lot of their materia
Um my husband and both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like tha
And while we're watching something I'll say OK honey what's going to happen next Or I'll tell him what think is going to happen nex
And if the way that the plot is um constructed if they've got like loopholes or got if it's nonsequitu
If things do not follow what consider logical or if they make some kind of leap that is not explained or not presented at least so you can leap with them or see how they made that leap then it leaves me col
really don't want to um watch that show any more So it basically uh turns you from the um plot instead of going with the plo
Have you ever thought about because of your love for books have you ever thought about writing Absolutel
don't perceive in myself and maybe this I'll gain this as get older but my attempts at short stories at least have left me flat don't do very well in cultivating the characters you kno
Now the writing that do like the journaling that do um of course that's real life so that has different intensit
Um the poem the poetry that write and the songs that write um depending on whether felt that it has meet met guess my criteria for excellence um I am working on compiling my poetr
And my family is chompingatthebit ready for me When are you going to publish And when it's ready it'll be ready and really can't rush tha
No but even having mean think have my mom my grandmother says I know you have enough stuff put together Like it doesn't take that much But um the book that I'm working on there's certain flow that anticipated having and at this point there're gaps Umhu
But umm as soon as those gaps are filled then the book will be ready and we'll we'll move you kno
By that point in time the Lord will have shown me you know who to present it to as far as uh uh presenting it for publicatio
Have you ever because uh of your race have you ever thought about writing about um you know the Blacks and culture and and maybe have you ever had any interest also in any Black writers Oh absolutel
My heritage is Black and Indian and White and Jewish that know of There may be others but those are the the the strains that know of or the races that know of and um know that there are gaps in what kno
Umm but because our family history or mean there is so much history that don't know; but because of so many complex issues regarding my family don't think the older members of my family could probably appreciate me writing about umm our racial heritage at this particular point in tim
Maybe umm maybe at some point in the future although now that you have brought it up I'll have to consider it more strongly just thought about it because being February and and um it's Black American History Mon th or something like that and I'm I'm doing report on that on Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God and um found her to be very interesting but uh she writes solely upon the Black culture and her experiences in growing u
So didn't know if you had any experiences reading any of the materials that the Black writers female Black writers have whether that material interested yo
Um her Know Why the Caged Bird Sings um having experienced pain in my childhood her writing about her pain which you know write about my pain privately in my journal but writing it for someone else to read is totally different story And thought that was very courageous for her and still enjoy listening to her and hearing the wisdom that she has to share um regarding not letting life's experiences bitter yo
Unfortunately don't remember everything I've ever read I have the same problem  And that's challenging  But one of the things that um guess if any particular subject that would feel that might write about it wouldn't just be from like uh the Black culture because other than my experiences in the Black culture tend to not be traditional from the standpoint that don't seem to fit in or be generally excepted um at least from childhood perspectiv
Um but even in our family it is incredible to me how the different shades of color of our skin bring prejudices from both sides or from from all the different shade
She married man who had Black blood but um she was ostracized in her family because of the Indian colorin
She had more of it than any of the other children so they would call her derogatory name
And um from her offspring which some married into the white race some married into the Black race Umhu
As matter of fact didn't even know that we had the myriad of cousins that we do Um
Come to find out at my dad's death that um one of the reasons that he shielded us from them was because of their hatred for us which was incredible to me had no clu
would have to have positive reason for writing about it because you know at this point don't have happy ending to the story Ye
Like write for myself in my journal and don't hide things in that but haven't gotten to the point of sharing my journals with the world Did your journaling come from teacher's uh uh expectation of you know that some teachers they require student to write in journal everyda
Um Miss Red think it was in tenth grade required us to write everyday in our journal and then get to turn it i
And um and being willing to let you know someone know my heart so to speak because felt very privatel
Um my mom had always warned us to be very careful about what we put on paper so the really innermost things of my heart didn't write um until got much olde
Then we took Discipleship Class um my husband and I that that um really taught us how to study the Bible and journaling and Bible Study became enmeshed so to speak for m
So when spent time in the Scriptures I um write my insights and sometimes write my prayers and also you know pour out my hear
My journals have uh taken much different character as uh as I've grown older and learned different thing
The teacher in high school that started you with your journal did she also um did she also activate in you desire for any reading or other types of writing or did another teacher Or did that stop back in your sixth grade class No um actually that teacher did encourage me to writ
It was actually the librarian in my high school experience that um she was uh also uh creative writer and um we would share poetr
And um think more than my teacher she really guess you would say inspired me to uh cultivate it and express myself more so in that that wa
Umm high school was when would write it down and keep it mean have things now that can go back to uh poems that wrote in high school but was writing before that just you know how things just disappear Ye
We moved quite bit and you know have no clue what happened with all of thos
Well Mom had six kids so it probably ended up you know in the trash because it was just such volume of mail Righ
Uh but I've been really glad that I've held on to the early things that wrot
One of the poems that um still pull out and read from time to time is um Can Be Me All By Myself Do you remember it Oh from memory No u
What sparked you to write that one Uh one of the things that didn't would never be able to articulate as child; but looking back um there was a there was certain chameleon quality to my personalit
was very much pleaser and whatever the authority figure who was with wanted from me was what tried to give the
And um guess in a in way was kind of frustrated with my own chameleon sel
was always being someone else or what was expected of me and um that's not necessarily bad thing except for um sometimes it was very um the expectations were opposite
And so you know if one person wants you to be the opposite of another person mean who are you really when you please when you are trying to please both people you know God forbid they'd both be in the same room at the same time That would be problem wouldn't it It woul
But one of the books one of the one of the uh writers that have been able to appreciate um is A
And as you can see my Pooh characters I've got collection of the original Pooh Tale
He captured personalities in way that um still go back to th those uh Pooh and Eeyor
When I'm my husband and talk personality lot and you know what personality type is particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type; we're all conglomerate
But he the way that he wrote the characters and um uh captured the different personality types was has intrigued me even to this day and can really appreciate um how he did tha
And there are times when can really identify with Pooh and then there are have my Eeyore Days don't always appreciate what Disney has done with it now because they have commercialized it so but um that's one of the few things I never really was cartoon kid mean my siblings watched and know what they were but um it was so funn
And um the my partner was drawing anvil but can't remember now what he was trying to get me to say but it was from cartoo
It was like I don't know what that cartoon was about didn't watch cartoons Cartoons really just mean even to this day think How can people watch that junk But Winnie the Pooh is one of the cartoons that can appreciate But the rest of them can lump them all in the same bag and don't have much use for the
Did you seem to assimilate that into his descriptions and characters Did you try to say I'm more like this one than this one Did you make any connections there No not al al
wasn't so much even I did not even know how to wish could put my hands on i
If had of thought about it had no clue that we were even going to talk about hi
think where in the world do have that Umm know have written it down but am trying to think where is my book It will come to me and I'll I'll maybe be able to find it and don't mind sharing it with yo
was unsure about who really was because was pretending so much so it wasn't had no clu
At at that point in time wasn't even thinking in the personality realm and hadn't drawn any connection to i
Um it was it was just um more of my you know how the teenagers go through uh Trying to find myself questioning period And that was one of the poems that came out of my Who Am I What am doing here And why type of you know struggl
But um It's been really uh encouraging for me as have um grown up and um look back to that poem because to some degree have learned now that can be myself all by mysel
don't have to be pleaser although do still enjoy people being pleased with me Who doesn't But umm I've I've learned that um the Lord is pleased with me and if do what is pleasing to Him you know everybody else the chips fall where they may 
Going back to your high school your favorite book in fifth grade wasn't it the dictionary Uhhu
Did that change Did your favorite book become something else when you grew up little bit more and you were in high school  Well it didn't the dictionary is still one of my favorite books but one of the books that read over and over again and still periodically check it out in the library and read Little Wome
Um her writings not just Little Women but Little Men and Jo's Boys um I I've appreciated um her imaginatio
In some parts know it was based on her life and so there is ring of reality but there again hadn't realize this till we were talking but you have the different personality type
And although was wasn't really tomboyish but was definitely not interested in boys And umm so I uh I've actually that's one of the few movies when see when they've done remakes of it different times that I've been able to appreciate every single version of i
Usually if I've read the book and then see the movie I'm like uh sigh  It takes something away from the boo
Well my imagination is very different from their imagination so don't when read the book my imagination is engaged and um think of things certain way and it's very rare when can appreciate somebody else's imagination if it's contrary to what my imagination say
Um so that became that has become one of my favorites Little Women that started in um high schoo
Um there is something I've got to tell you it's just uh uh one of the things that my sister who is like two years behind me sai
couldn't understand her frustration she says Do you know that there's not book in this library that your name isn't in don't know why that tickles me so much but Back in those days when you check out book they put your name in i
 And she couldn't and every time she checked out book my name was already there But that probably went to the fact that she wanted to be the oldest and umm that was something that reminded her that she was not the first Not the first one That's interestin
It doesn't matter what it's in It was from her end more than from my end because was the oldes
You couldn't dispute that But um one of the other areas uh did learn to enjoy can't remember exactly when it was but science fiction became became intriguing to me and think it was during high school year
That would be the antithesis of biography Oh know know Not that would appreciate everybody's science fiction but uh there is trilogy that ha ve read and it's The Foundation Trilogy and uh I'm trying to remember who wrote i
can't think of the author right now but it's one that both my husband and have enjoye
can't think of the writer's name but the writer does so well with um with intrigue and iron
And one of the things that have found whether it's in movie or book it's got to engage me psychologically on some leve
It must be the chronic fatigue robbing me Um it will probably pop in at some point so I'll let you kno
Oh For the most part think it's pretty clean and that's something else really appreciate is when don't have to do deal with lot of profanity or unwholesomenes
You know there is so much that you can write about that's good and wholesome and intriguing without going into the areas that are unprofitable that um and don't haven't read The Foundation again in like probably the last five years but um periodically I'll feel like I've got to visit this book again So you don't mind rereading Oh no especially that's how know what my favorite books are because they are books go back t
Um oh there was one back from guess from the elementary years that had forgotten to mention to you um Harold and the Purple Pe
Harold was um little boy and the way that this book is written it's somebody that's drawin
Well Harold was draw was one who who drew and he would draw things with his pen that would come alive don't know there is just something about that book that even though haven't read it in decades that still intrigues me and want to put get my hands on it and read it agai
Umm as matter of fact when um oh guess my first radio job in VA I started doing this little um like anonymous gift thing Like with my coworkers might bake something or whatever and I'd had bought purple pen and would say The purple pen strikes again and uh no one ever knew it was from Harold and the Purple Pen But or don't don't don't think anyone ever knew it was from me unless somebody maybe figured out my handwriting or something like that but it was That's really neat the way you did tha
Do you always seem to have habit of making connections in your personal life with things you have read about Absolutely And so you celebrate those things like you did that one To some degre
mean obviously you see my Pooh stuff That's obvious To some degree things that really have an impact on me have tended to become part of my life on some level or anothe
mean may not it may not manifest in my everyday existence but um at some point or another when it's appropriate you know I'll reach back and re and connect to that book or that character or whatever or some aspect of it and bring it forwar
think that is really um putting your reading into reallife uh experiences and making your reading become part of you and personalizin
Really And with your ability to do that think that that carries over into your writin
Because what you read about might spark something that becomes an interest to you and then you carry it over into your writin
One of the recent when say recent in recent years read book about George Washington Carve
And it was incredible to me the things that he went through the the his intrigue with um discovering like all the uses for soy soy the soy the soybean um or peanut or whateve
mean went out and bought peanut oil just because he was in the book it it was saying um how good it was for your skin and stuff like that started in rubbing peanut oil got over it but and still use it You didn't get greasy effect did you really didn't mind the grease it was the smell But um yeah the books that have an impact on m
And um he took me to um Charleston and Folly Beach and to Isle of Palms because he knows love the ocea
That was ah my first thought There's got to be whole one down here somewhere But umm then as was thinking about it and was looking at it and at first wasn't even so much interested in the broken one
was picking up the broken pieces and it made me think about our own brokenness in our live
And um so it was just uh don't know you don't let your experiences whether they're experience it's experiences that you've read or what you've live
But then again maybe in reading took different because it was an escape for me maybe connected with it too much You never really escape from readin
Um enjoy visiting the different worlds so to speak you know of the character or whateve
Um and um and that's that's still an enjoyable thing for me you know when have the opportunit
Does that carry over we've talked about you know the area in that the reading and the writing does that carry over your love for all those things into theater as well Um have enjoyed um working in theater in my yout
Um guess the um lack of opportunity is probably the biggest aspect of why wouldn't now but if had the opportunity wouldn't min
And um when we were growing up uh our Sunday school youth group we we did put on plays and and so that there was an outlet in my youth in my younger days in colleg
What about attending theater and watching it Does that do uh does that do very much for you Or do you find that that is not the same as reading it It depend
It depends on the story and it depends on um well whether or not it's well don
Um when was in in junior high our orchestra teacher took us to see Fiddler on the Roo
Um it was one that thoroughly enjoyed and could you know get right and it is something that's one of my favorite stories although now that think about it I've never read i
I'll have to do that Put it on your list That's right Fiddler on the Roo
Um one of the plays enjoyed reading Lorraine START OF TAPE 1 SIDE NM Excuse m
And you saw it on television I've seen it on television and I've was interested in seeing it in the theater but but never had that opportunit
have not had lot of other than college productions and stuff like that uh haven't done lot of theater goin
But um it's um and I'm trying to think the theater uh other than Fiddler on the Roof of course haven't seen lot of different things but um has not had the same level of impact gues
Uh uh going to see The Fiddler on the Roof of course as violinist that you know was part of our our class um project and that was part of our appreciatio
So she wanted to expose us to that but uh that has um remained an intriguing story partially think because of the insight into different cultur
And um also when you think about the characters that are in Fiddler on the Roof you know they have very definite personalities And there you're again you're drawn to personalities in writing or even actin
Well understanding is one of the things if had to say that there was something underlying in my life I've always wanted to understand whether it was understanding people or understanding why things happe
Um understand why you know there are times know it must drive my husband crazy when we get to talking about particular word and I'm saying That doesn't mean that And he's like well that's what it you know that's what it means to him and I'm like Well let's get the dictionary We'll find out what Webster uh understood it to mean So we can have common ground so we can both speak the same language and we can both you know know what we're talking abou
Um that you know if you can get an understanding to clarify figure out where they're coming from and there again that personality thing Ye
Understanding um person's perspective from their personality view you know helps you whether you need to make allowances for them or um just uh figuring out the puzzle you kno
Whether it's life puzzles or um in my work um we we often find ourselves in situations where there are mysteries and we have to follow the clue
And I love love it when find the answer Everybody in the office knows I got it Did that ever lead you into mysteries for reading Um to some degre
But um sometimes guess find mysteries that leave gaps or don't follow them quite don't know whether it's my perspective or my languag
Now I'm the kind of person I'm very sequential I've got to know what the end is go to the back of the book to find out how it ende
But don't care about the middle part because somehow they lose me in the you know especially if they digress to other you know if they don't follow the stor
They go too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the uh issue is that they're dealing with you kno
Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines that does not appeal to me at all Are you in the habit then since you go to the back of the book for the mysteries are you having to do that with the other readings Um sometime
If if want to if really want to know how it ends and then really want to know how they got there then I'll do that but usually now I'm more patien
If they don't end it ri ght then I'm mad That's not how it should have ended Not that everything has to have happy ending it just has to have a Bible solution of one of the things going back to The Foundation Trilogy in their closing chap chapters well it's like two chapters that end the boo
And it's like the answer to the mystery that the characters are dealing with and they are satisfied with this answe
There's something well not only that aspect of the way that the writer he writes he basically gives two different endings to the stor
You know you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that's the end of the story but then you go to the next chapter and it's like Ah ha Umhu
don't know what it is about um my sense of humor which don't have don't have an appreciation of humor that seems like the general population ha
And can appreciate that they do but personally it doesn't tickle my funny bone but irony tickles me Umhu
Um and one of the other things that um almost had the name of the author um the writer of Foundation um that my husband and both have taken away from that book is um there is a guess philosophy so to speak of um the um there are couple of main groups in the story and the group that knows the most has certain philosoph
And uh we have seen guess the essence of that truth to be uh applicable in real lif
And so when book can take real life truth and weave it into the storyline then don't know even though it's novel it has basis in reality that's intriguin
We talked about the classics you know with Louisa May Alcott and uh do you have you ever read much of the realism in modern literature which deals with realistic living and realistic lives and realistic families and the way they really are and not something that's fictiona
Have you ever involved yourself much with the reading of that When you say modern do you mean like mean how modern are you talking about know there are degrees of modernnes
I'm talking about modern in the 19th or actually 20th centurytype of reading of novels in literatur
They deal very much with realism they don't like the authors don't like the Cinderella endings the Cinderella type of of storylin
So from that standpoint would say my answer to your question would be Yes And I'm trying to think of something specifi
Um it was where uh Caucasian man underwent treatment where his skin color was darkened and he experienced what it was like to be Blac
But think that you have to um You can tell enough of the story for people to understand without um mashing your face in it so to spea
And um I don't have high tolerance for violence and um I I recently read book um it was the author's name that attracted me to i
don't know if that will mean anything to you No didn't follow Star Trek that well He also does um Reading Rainbow for kid
Anyway it was his name that uh attracted me to the book and uh um I've read the book but threw it away Ooh would never want to read it agai
And you know um recently as matter of fact had situation where was at my grandmother's house and in the bedroom where was was boo
looked at it and couldn't believe that it was in her house And went to her and was expressing my concern to her and um of course that you don't throw away book came up But Gran Some books you just have to throw away mean it's garbage just garbage And it wasn't something that she rea
It was something that had come from someone who had gotten box of books and was somebody else's librar
But wasn't the only grandchild or greatgrandchild that was there and would have hated for some impressionable person to have gotten hold of it And being in grandmother's house they would have thought it was OK Um
She's um and probably liked poetry love of poetry comes from her because she would quote poetry all the tim
And that's one of the things that is handed down from my grandmother to my mom and um you know to us and to the greatgrandchildren as wel
One of the poems that she would quote to my mom and don't know the whole poem but it starts off I have to live with myself so have to be fit for myself to know um can't keep on the closet shelf lot of secrets about myself think that no one will ever know That's where get lost But she can quote the whole thin
And so yes she definitely um in the um time where she was raising her children it was really a challenge to um that she took on to encourage them to be their absolute bes
And um she definitely believed that education was essential and You will go to college So that was something that was definitely handed dow
Did she ever read stories to you Or did she just quote poetry Um don't know that my grandmother has ever really read book to m
mean she was either working for living or she was working to take care of u
And she was can't don't remember whole lot of leisure where she now she's more leisurel
And one thing that we do is play Scrabble And she still beats me She does can play as hard and the best can and she can still beat me So she's still living And still has her wits about her  Oh yes Definitely  And that's real blessin
didn't now my mom has piles of books and piles of articles takes two papers and it's EVERYWHERE Does she collect or does she read She reads and she collects And um try to keep my piles under contro
And periodically have to go through and will go to like the library book sales and I'll choose to take what piles either the author or the title that will interest m
And then I'll eventually get around to reading it and whether it stays or goes depends on what it's like Yea
Do you have collection of special books Oh definitely Ones that always will have and will never get rid o
And since I've got one of the few nonfiction books that uh and again it's based on um reality is Hannah Hurnard's Hind's Feet in High Places and Mountains of Spice
And the depiction the the the story that she depicts um is so to me has so many aspects of true the struggles of our lives that every time read it because I'm little different get something little different from i
And that's one that give it away and then have to go get another copy Because always want that in my librar
Um in your high school years you're going back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry Umhu
Um did she did you meet weekly or was it was in there everyday Everyday Several times day Now that was still during those times in high school Umhu
got permission to have homeroom in the library and then would go there for my lunch and mean would take me like that long to eat my food and would go I have permission to go up to the library Um
And so um found it kind of like being the librarian helper because was there all the tim
And uh I as matter of fact at one point was going to go into Library Scienc
Um at this particular point physically it's not something could keep up with but um the library is actually my favorite plac
Other than home Uh well if had my way I'd have the library in my home That's possible you kno
know You've probably collected enough books that you could fill up room with them Yep Well we have study that we have filled you know you've seen our study the books that we hav
And I'm I'm now with Ron's collection and mine I'm starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves books that he's collected and going to read thos
Are your bothers or sisters as much of reader as you are Or have an interest at all in reading Oh um think there are six of us all together and there's only one brothe
To my recollection think all but one of my siblings is very strong in the area of readin
And that one sibling is she came up at time when they switched from phonics to sightreading Ye
All of her life she has struggled with um not being able to sound out words and that it it has really limited her in reading and it's not very much fun to he
But the rest of my siblings um are always kind of not so much that they're doing don't get the sense that they're doing so much leisure reading now but they are um always you know continuing their education in whatever area they're studying in and their reading in that are
She grew up near the Coliseum and she has some interesting stories to tell about her grandmother
And with no further ado grew up on 100acre farm which is hard to believe now near the airport which was not nearly as intrusive as it is now because this was backing up to my father's parent's who came down here from Wisconsin in 1937 looking for Southern way of life to get away from all that sno
They bought this farm off of Wilmont Road think it's still Wilmont Road anyhow it's near the new Coliseum on Tyvola and proceeded to turn it into working plantation at least that was my grandmother Tina's ambitio
My father and his brother helped them build the house twostory white stucco with the first oil furnace in Charlotte or so the family history goe
My father and mother met shortly thereafter and married in 1930 May of 1938 think because came along two years later and grew up with my grandmother Tina there to kind of well remember when was about five years old and we had settled down for the long haul on the farm after my father finished traveling around and taking us with him to various uh Air Force assignments out in Texas and oh Myrtle Beac
But think about the time started first grade he stopped traveling and my little grandmother Tina who ruled everyone with an iron hand had been living in what we called the big house I'm I'm going on too muc
But anyhow moved her over to the cottage so my parents could have little life of their own and the little cottage was right across one of the lawns from us and her other son lived in little house down from the cottag
So it was like the Borden compound When was in the eighth grade uh our savings ran out pretty much so my mother told my father was being gentleman farme
During these years we raised Angus cattle and ate very well with vegetables from the garden but we didn't have any mone
So my other grandmother came to live with us to take care of the children and my mother and father both found jobs in tow
And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite gif
Grandmother Tina had traveled uh as the wife of military man herself and had real interest in adventure in other cultures uh the outofdoors and remember when was five or six she would take me by the hand and say Where would you like to go for walk and I'd point and we'd go off in that direction Wo
Across the fields and through the woods and over streams and think what it did was wet my appetite for exploring new place
The other grandmother probably had an eighthgrade education but fabulous mind for invention because she came up with these storie
When was about seven my mother was pregnant with my little sister they sent me to live in Chapel Hill for six weeks toward the end of her pregnanc
And that grandmother was staying with my mother's brother and his family on farm outside Chapel Hill while he was getting uh PhD and would be homesick and my grandmother we called her Granny her name was Millie Frances would make up these stories about this great white snowy owl that would carry me home to see my famil
Of course if thought about it now I'd think of him carrying me home in his big claws but for child it was very comfortin
And then she came to live with us probably four or five years more later while was in the eighth grade so it would have been eight years later and she loved gardening and flower
And think got some of that from her because still whenever I'm out in the yard gardening think about Granny my mother's mothe
And when I'm traveling sometimes think about Tina and how much she would have enjoyed i
Mostly she told me stories about all the things would inherit from her once she was gone Did you di
She she collected Chinese furniture and rugs and that sort of thing while they were based in Panama and she took great pride in the
Pride of possession suppose but also loved the thought that it would pass on to me one da
And back then she bought them really cheaply because Panama was free port and she would get these really nice wooden carved things from China for five 15 dollars Wo
That don't know what they'd be worth now but have rosewood screens that are handcarved that 10 15 years ago were valued at something like 1800 dollars apiec
And the rugs are out of style but and they're rolled up underneath our beds for the most par
At first kind of resented having to take all this stuff because it meant could never decorate the way wanted to decorate but got over that and realized you can have an eclectic mix of stuf
And it's nice to have some good pieces of furniture that have that history attached to the
And the other grandmother had nothing really of her own to leave us except rocking chair that think was her mother'
She got senile couple of years before she died and had graduated from college and my mother was taking care of her and my father had died and we kept her at home and under control with Thorazin
And remember terrible time when my mother had gone to the grocery store and had left me was there for the weekend home from worked in Shelby or Gastonia at the tim
And tried to make her take her pill and she hit me and hit her bac
It shocked her and she took her pill And settled down And the other grandmother had series of strokes and my poor mother who was widowed was she widowed then No she was widowed shortly after Tina died uh but my father was working and my mother think was kind of in charge of finding housekeepers to take care of Tina who loved nothing better than to order people aroun
She was hard to get along with and people would quit and Mom would rehire them or Tina would fire them and Mom would rehire them and she finally wound up at the Huntersville at what's now the Huntersville Oak Yea
She was not woman of leisure but she always fancied being that so she would get this this barrels of fine china and handpaint them and fire them and initial the
She was from Czecho her parents were from Czechoslovakia and that was her maiden name but it was shortened to Petric when they came over her
So she was Kathryn Petric Borden and so my mother had no choice in the matter had to be Kathry
Well she had the choice of the middle name but it had to start with and she thought about Penelope but luckily settled on Patricia Borde
So here have all these monogrammed linen napkins that sit in this uh pigskin trunk that was handpainted by my grandmother Tina with brass clas
She didn't specify who would get what and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff Mom said Ok how are you and Anne going to do this And so we said We'll flip coin and see who goes first So that's how we did Anne would pick something and then would pick something and then if one of us would pick something the other really wanted we'd work it out and so that was You two were the only two grandchildren Um hu
And guess they um don't know how they figured that out because wasn't around when that was settled but know that they we all got something like $1500 plus furnishing
Until recently when went up to see my cousin Cindy and she unrolled this wall hanging this thick rug that was handwoven of the 12 immortal
My sister has the matching one and Cindy has this Westerntype log house and said This rug it there's nowhere to put it They had things like stuffed animals on their wall
So what did she do with the rug Did she give it to you Uh huh and now it's under another of my beds at home It's really beautiful but maybe one day I'll have bigger house with bigger wall that can put it o
But really got tired of her talking about the day when she passed on and would get all these thing
thought of it as kind of emotional blackmail in way but years later don't really think it wa
Why did you call her Tina though From Kathryn My mother came up with that nicknam
She uh all the other relatives called her Kathryn or Aunt Kathryn or whatever but guess because she's little or was little maybe Tina kind of sounded like teeny asked my mother how she came up with it and she said she didn't know it just kind of fit her and so from then on she was Tin
Whereas my other grandmother who used snuff and was very very religious to the point of being fanatic uh was perfect grann
My mother made her cotton dresses that came down below her calf and she wore these shoes that are now in vogue the black The granny shoe
But it was sad when she started to lose her memory because she would pull up plants out of seaso
She'd still want to garden and things would be coming up and she would think it was time to pull them ou
You'd have to kind of go behind her and say Whoa But she was a she was sweetheart they both were in their own way
Because know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on farm and was one of three or four kids and she inherited her father's mother for season out of every yea
Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes and my mother told me this not long before she died but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying The first thing I'm going to do is unwrap this cocoon She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably Oh n
But she had just layers and layers and it was just can imagine her just grabbing it and going bloop and throwing all that in the wash pot and getting her cleaned u
She was great big and looked very sour but uh they all had stories of their ow
don't now let's see which one was it I'll tell you this one last story because it's great story going back to the Civil Wa
And it might have been this very woman who when she was little girl this would be my greatgrandmother Maryann Joyner uh her father went off to fight in the war on the Confederate side from Cabarrus Count
They presumed dead the war ended he never came back they never learned what happened to him and so she took up with this guess he was traveling salesman with wagon and mul
And she put her two children Maryann and her little brother Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point and they took they moved down or were going to move down to Georgi
But he what happened think they both died of malaria which was pretty prevalent along the coastal area and left the two kids on their ow
PG And were taken in by this old man older man who was probably guess 40's early 50s maybe who had sick wife and flock of kid
He brought them in took her in guess both of them with the understanding she would take care of his wife and the kid
Huh So don't know what the age difference was but it was probably 30 35 year
Yeah tried to get my mother well did have my mother on tape te lling about it and then lost the tape But there's so many things like that wish had known to ask both grandmother
Because on the other side of course they fought with the Yankees My grandfather's father or maybe my grandfather's grandfather uh fought in the Civil War and he was captured and went to what's that awful prison in South Carolina Uh know what you're talking abou
They were living in Pennsylvania and he walked back from Charleston area to Pennsylvania after the war like so many other people had to do because there was no other way to get ther
Except for well there's my grandmother Tina who grew up in Wisconsin in the central part of the state while it was still Indian territory and you know you know the dining table at my hous
Have told you the story about it No It was her mother's table and chairs and it was the table that she would put all her weekly baking on every Monday for the famil
My grandmother Tina was like the youngest of these kids and she was guess eight or nine when this happened but they everybody mean the Indians were part of the community although they kind of kept to themselves but they knew what was going on and they would have dealings with the settler
Well my grandmother Tina who was little girl got sick with some fever and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhauste
And the Indians some of the Indians knew about it and they said they said to Tina's mother You go get some slee
We'll take care of your little girl So they brought her some sort of herbal concoction and broke her fever and she got better and they went awa
And they came back the next Monday after the baking was done and they gathered up the four corners of the tablecloth and took the week's worth of baking out the door which they figured was their due Without saying word Yea
Wow you have any idea what year that was Can you trace it back Yeah it would have been let's see my father was born in 190
Tina would have been about 20 early 20s at that point so early 1885 Yeah thereabouts It was truly the wild frontier And here you ar
Disney World is uh is one of my favorite favorite family stories and one of the reasons why it's my favorite family story is because we had been there think just once when you guys were real little uh no when you were two we took you bac
You do Mmm OK so anyhow remember it was really really hot and it was real crowde
It was really crowded and uh and we got there and we didn't really know what to do what to do first so we sort of had different group
That was Mark and and Mark and Kim and me and then there was the grandparents group that would sort of you know stay in the shadows and take it easy because it really was ho
forget Mom lost count how many times you were on that merrygoround because you were too littl
You did and this is what you did the rest of the time you were at Disney Worl
So you rode the merrygoround and we'd go back and meet you every once in while and you were having great tim
We didn't care and the merrygoround was uh was as good as it got for yo
And then we started looking uh for other rides as we all got back together and we took you to uh forget which other ones we went to the little helicopters I'm sure and some of the other fun rides the little boats and that sort of thing and then we saw Small World and had no idea what it was like because had never heard of it but this is Disney classic this is the best ride they have in sense makes Disney makes Disney what it i
And we all climbed into this boat and I'm climbing into boat thinking Who wants to do this We got in and there was lots of people around and we took you know we took half an hour to get there because the line was really long and finally we were in the boa
This little two year old perched in the front on the boat you know on the bow just floating around and remember you were pretty quiet you didn't really say too muc
Dad didn't say you could talk about me during the interview Well hey I'm in charge her
Yeah OK good Uh so then we then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this um this long stretch where all of sudden it's this like this big long cave and it's all there's stuff all around the walls and there are uh and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff and singing and the music is uh So anyway along we came into this big cavern and there were these big dolls and bright colors and trains just kind of lurching through this this wate
It was really cool actually and don't remember when it started because all of us were kind of looking around but somebody said Look at Melissa And there's this little two year old just froze
Your mouth was open your eyes were bigger than I'd ever seen and just staring at everythin
mean once in while you'd laugh or you'd giggle and we stopped watching this great ride just watched yo
It was just so much fun it was like it was like the best that Disney could be at just the perfect time for little ki
We've been to Disney think three or four times total but that's like my all time favorite one really good tim
Probably close tie with uh Space Mountain who Kim and Mark that was fun too but um yeah those are our u
OK so what else do you want me to talk about So another story that comes to mind is summer family vacation and one of my favorite was in uh Roger's Rock up in the uh Adirondack
I would say your Mom and were in our late thirties and you were um um well anyway it doesn't matte
Um so we went to Roger's Rock you know family camping and this is not your mom's idea of the ultimate vacatio
Uh it kind of was mine but uh your mom wasn't so sure but we had really nice weathe
And we were there for week and we had the old uh the old blue the old blue tent you remember The huge one with the three rooms and the the holes in the top that we fixed and everything that that your mom is keeping i
We went to the beach did some shopping think and exploring but then uh think the next to last night we decided to have special like special camping end of camping trip dinner and we got everything all goin
We were going to be grilling and everything making beets on the stove lobster or something and barbecuing and all tha
And after three days of the best weather we'd ever had the clouds just opened up and it started raining and it was raining really har
remember thinking Boy it can't rain any harder than this because we were sitting there with rain pounding all around us and you know everything we owned getting wet and the tent soaking through sleeping bags getting we
And remember your mom sort of sitting in the car looking at me and don't know what you kids were doing probably sitting in the car with her and I'm standing out there in the rai
And so here everyone is in the car think with the door open or the window at least watching me and I'm standing there in the rain hoping it would end not wanting to give up on my vacation or your
And remember that it had rained so hard that the boiling water in the campfire that was cooking the beets had cooled down and really like beets and remember the beets were sort floating to the top and remember it was sort of like this cave man moment looked at the beet thought about it for minute reached in kind of picked it up like an apple and thought This looks good And so took took big bite and remember looking over at Mom and don't know what she did but uh all of sudden the signal got clea
So we threw open the back of the Vega and took all our camping stuff everythin
We didn't even pack it we just wadded it just mushed it all up running around this incredible torrential rain shoved it into the back of the car and uh went home one night earl
Yeah Grandpa and Grandma Hebard whenever we went camping every single time it rained it rained har
This was in place you may see some day called Zoar Valley it's in uh where is it Cattaraugus County which is the next county down from Erie County which is where Buffalo i
And so that was the place where Andy and Mom and Saul the guys and would all go in high school on weekends and usually we would just go to uh to walk along the path because it's huge uh it's got Cattaraugus County Creek down at the bottom of it it's got great big shale cliffs with lots of really loose shale on it and usually we'd walk along the stream bank and go swimming and jump off cliffs that sort of thin
But once we decided to climb it it didn't look too tough to climb up so we thought What the heck let's give it shot Andy and did this and actually think we climbed down from the to
It was fairly shallow fairly uh fairly shallow angle for about oh don't know two or three hundred yards and then we couldn't see over the edge down to the creek which was like way down ther
So we climbed up part way down and it was like walking in uh in a in great big pile of ball bearings you know It was like really loos
It would crunch under your feet it got really dusty you know it wasn't like earth at al
And because it was slanted you'd slide on it little bit and about 15 steps into it we looked at each othe
We both like skiing and went skiing Let's ski this stuff and in little while we went Yeah you can probably see what's coming here Uh didn't go over the edge by the wa
We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust and it was really fun and Andy finally qui
He got tired and thought I'd go little farther and skied few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged fairly good size rock which had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward m
And I'm skiing away having great time and once when came up remember can still remember came up in mid air and was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn and Wham this rock smacks right into my hi
It didn't hurt wasn't injured but it hit me in just the right place so that it knocked me right over and all the sudden was like running like had completely lost my balance and I'm running down this shale as fast as can which is fine normall
The problem is uh you can run forever because you hit this drop off and the drop is sheer probably hundred feet or more straight down to the cree
So was running down as fast as can to get there so could drop off the en
And remember thinking I can't do this And on and on we went and all remember is it was getting closer and really couldn't figure out wa
would try and fall down and I'd sort of bounce up again and uh you almost didn't get to be my daughter because of this this was really clos
What was kind of well this was really dangerous as it turned out and wasn't sure what was going to d
It wasn't Andy he was watching all this thinking This is it So was getting pretty clos
Another rock that we had knocked loose up above was bouncing down behind me and it caught me agai
It just smacked me right down into the shale like big hand just pushing me right down into this loose dusty shale and hard enough so sank in little bi
was dug in with my fingers and my toes and began to slide on my face instead of running and slide down more and more and stopped and as the over the years think the distance from the drop off where stopped gets closer and closer in about eight inches approximatel
don't know it could have been 50 yards it could have been 10 feet but it was too close whatever it wa
And remember sitting there and kind of looking down at the edge for moment going Whoa That could have been it That's think that's the closest ever came the most dangerous thing that ever happened to me but the good news was it was easy to walk to the to
It just took while so turned back around sort of crawled through this shale listening to Andy yell insults from up abov
It's metamorphic rock so it's made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years so it's really kind of loose kind of rock and the shale that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collecte
And so we were skiing in big piles of loose rock was what it came down t
I'm interviewing Debra Hicks on November 24 1999 and she is going to tell us story that she remembers from her childhoo
Um she was at the time there was lot of racial tension that was going on so she felt like she wouldn't be able to make i
She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u what ethnic background she wanted to use so she decided to use her black heritage um backgroun
And so she moved to New York and she went to school there she made it through school and she did become attorne
She later was going through problems because they found out that she was black ethnic and not white so they would she could no longer work with the fir
Um they had no sufficient reason as to why they wanted to cancel didn't want her to be um the attorne
Um so they told her she wasn't doing good with her cases so she decided finally she left the fir
She got married and she married this uh very predominant guy who's very very welloff and they moved back to their her hometown in G
So she decided that she would go and visit her grandmother who raised her and her grandmother was telling how she told her it would be hard and for her to make it once she let it known that she was an African AfroAmerica
So she decided that she would start an organization and can't remember the name of it to where it has something to do with women's um Women's Black American Women's something and to she um let me see what els
She started the organization and can't remember the name of the organization and um she helped out lot of of women that uh that were black women that were having problems being able to make it in society because of their their color or their culture backgroun
And um let's see she didn't she her grandmother passed away and she um after her grandmother passed away she moved from GA her and her husband she did have child and um so she moved back to New York and she uh after she finished helping with this um women organization um she went back into law practic
read this story and it was very good story and um it was just meaningful and touching that how you know we as as individuals can criticize our own color because of being little shade lighter or hair is straighter than your hair or whateve
So it was book that you read It actually it started out as story that had to do for a my senior project senior exi
Oh So y'all made it up We made the story up but actually the story there was story very similar um same name everythin
Everything was the same except our name wasn't in the copyright nowhere but ah it was story an actual truthful stor
Ah it's ah April 14th at about six o'clock on Friday and we're here with Sam Hodges and he's going to tell us story he heard ah when you were child is that right Yeah basically when was chil
And how old were you when you heard the story Umm I'd say was in actually Cub Scouts at the time so guess that would put me about probably about about eight or nin
Eight or nine that's So  Pretty long time ago huh   So this was this was in the mid um this was late late 1970s about 7
And uh Sam ah is resident of Charlotte for 11 years and he was born in Durham and he is um he's Caucasian male banker who has education of BS in international business and um think we're ready for the story no
The story actually started out and heard it first when when was growing up as kid but as mentioned earlier Cub Scouts were actually out camping so it's definitely stor
Um was about eight um um we were out camping in the back basically in the back of friend of mine's house in Orange Count
He basically they had basically woods outdoors and there were parents there with us but we were only eight so we're learning how to camp um we actually slept that night in teepee uh uh an original teepee that uh were used by Native Americans at one time sort of as historical artifac
So we're getting ready for bed we've eaten dinner we're around the campfire and the owner of the property it's Dwayne Hobgood guess can say his nam
There's about six or seven of us little kids eightyears old this is man that's going to be giving good stor
Do you want to hear or do you want to keep Where was before we were interrupted The uh you were uh Hobgood's property an
Eh boys I've got story for you and we're sitting around the campfire he goes Gentlemen let me tell you the story of Two Feathers He goes Two Feathers was and this time political correctness wasn'
He grew up in Orange County or what was Orange County it wasn't named Orange County at the tim
Um and act and he says Two Feathers was um once again was an Indian who uh lived there back before before it was settled by the Europeans He says Two Feathers grew up he hunted he fished bas basic the basic Indian life um until one day when he was about 20 25 he was out hunting and he was hunting mountain lio
So he doesn't know but he he doesn't die he survives um and grows old becomes an old old an old Indian and um um becomes you know one of the leaders of the tribe but he's always got this one goal is to find that mountain lion that got his arm and really he doesn't really care that much about the mountain lion he wants his arm or somebody's ar
Um and what happens is as the settlers move in he actually finds um because he doesn't want to take people you know from his own tribe's arm but he needs an arm so he's spending all of eternity hunting for his arm and um as you know time comes on and the settlers start in the region settler
Um one day one guy wakes up in the morning; he's bleeding; he felt like he doesn't have an arm and he sees this ghost of an India
He's got his arm and uh he's trying to put it on his body and it didn't fit and it's too short and it didn't look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes o
Um this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps going on and o
And you know as an adult it's not it's you know he it's good story but as an eightyearold kid you're worried about your ar
And because he usually catches people not in their house but when they're out camping or sleepin
He tells us his story he says you know You've got to watch out for your ar
Spend the night um you know because if he comes his name's Two Feathers but there's chant um in regards to you know to getting him away and it goes something like Two Feathers be gone want my arm '' Um and there's also other things you can do to deter hi
You can also um in front of your teepee you have to stack stones in certain manner in order to say Hey I'm friend and not foe I'd like to keep my arm So he proceeds to have us um build the stones and um you know learn the chant we're chanting and sends us off to be
Now don't know if this actually applies as story heard sort of an embellishment on this story in regards to give you the details bu
remember my dad telling funny story about my brother my oldest brother and they had purchased this huge like little general store type thing that had all these um boxes and cartons and stuff that you would put together and um it was actually like little storefront thin
And they had spent all night with couple of friends of theirs assembling all of these toys and boxes and you know the stickers on the boxe
And then um Christmas morning my oldest brother woke up and was sick and my younger brother had the um measles and was sick and screaming and crying and they had the house full of all these little boxes and things from this uh toy store that had been put u
And it was so miserable and the house was so crowded and the kids were so wild that by Sunday by that Christmas afternoon they had taken everything down and boxed everything back up again just to get it out of the way just because they uh were so miserable that Christmas because my brother had been so sic
Um another time this was for the um other brother um the one that had been sick as baby they bought him one year all this um cowboy and Indian stuff and again all this assembly was required and um the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes few years earlier for my other brother um had come over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians and um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little ittybitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys and uh then you know all the little um suits and headdresses and everything that had to go on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuf
And Dad said they were up till like four o'clock in the morning getting all this stuff put together and were just exhausted and about dea
And then um of course you know both of my brothers woke up about five a
And you know think by the end of the day my brother had lost half the toys and you know half the little pieces and all this kind of stuff and um it was very frustrating u
Then remember um one Christmas for me um had been begging and begging for like this uh Barbiehead thing that you could you know put makeup on and style the hair and all this kind of stuff and um my dad worked uh for textile compan
He was an engineer and he um had to travel around to lots of different mills and stuff and so um everywhere he had been he just could not find this Barbiehead thing you know and it was just you know getting closer and closer to the time and he was starting to pani
And so finally you know some little town that you know he had had to go to um he found one um in stor
And so that was my big Christmas present well when put makeup on her um it just wouldn't even rub off mean it was just like this you know permanent stuff that you couldn't even smudge off or wash off even with soap and wate
It just absolutely would not come off and so it was like one time and you were done and that was i
mean he was ready to kill me because I you know didn't play with it anymore the rest of the da
And kept trying to tell him Well you know The makeup is not coming off You know Nothing is smudging off and can't redo her makeup because it's on there and you know It's not coming off And oh he was just furiou
He probably would have sold me to the highest bidder at that point or maybe even the lowest bidder to just get rid of m
Um and um remember another time um being told about time when the family was up in the mountain
But it was near um on the way to Chimney Rock think and it was just off the side of the road and and where the river was and there was great big old flat rock that sort of jutted out into the river and um we would go up there you know occasionally on the weekends and have like picnic and stuff on the roc
And um to the side of the rock there was like little pool where the water wasn't too swift and you could um kind of play aroun
Classes may have your attention Um and so there was an area that you could swim in you know to the one sid
But in front of the rock on you know the other three sides of this big rock the river was very swif
And remember them telling me one time um that my youngest well not youngest but the younger brother the one in the middle um had just you know jumped off into this swift moving river and um he was always quite the daredevil and still is even in his 40s um but he just decided he wanted to go swimming in the deep water and he jumped of
And um then my oldest brother he's the hero and the rescuer and so well he jumps i
So then of course my dad had to jump in and uh fortunately for them no one was you know smashed against another rock or anything like tha
Staff may have your And he caught uh he managed to catch both my brothers and uh they got to the side of the river and so of course now you know my mother think um was pregnant with me at the tim
So here she's standing on this rock you know about to burst with baby and you know screaming and crying because all three of her family members are getting swept away in this rive
But they uh finally got out and managed to make their way back up to the roc
Um remember another time uh being told uh about storm that had come up that my dad had taken um my two brothers and um can't remember if was with them or no
My brothers are quite bit older than me um and think was young and um he had taken us and don't know maybe few other of the neighborhood kids and my mother was at uh choir practice at that time at the church and so he had the rest of us like at little park that was down the stree
And uh all of sudden one of these you know really fast violent summer storms came up and um everybody was just petrifie
And he said somebody had like don't know little drum or stick or something can't remembe
So he says we ended up underneath one of the shelters and that was the only you know shelter in this whole park because it was all wide ope
So we have all these kids and my dad underneath this big shelter and we were marching around the picnic table singing and you know marching and letting the thunder kind of be like the cymbals you know of marching ban
And just um he said he didn't he didn't have any idea how many laps we did around that table but it was just through the whole storm and we just marched and sang for that whole storm just round and round and round that little table um underneath the shelte
He said it was the only thing he could think of to keep everybody from crying and screaming and not just absolutely petrified of this storm um and remember one other time when was little um my dad as said earlier my dad traveled lot with his job and um there were also times when he had to travel out of the countr
And um when was very young um you know he would be gone maybe you know month or two and then be home two or three months and then be gone again you know and so each time you know he came home there was period of few days or even week or so that was real adjustment period for me you know because he'd been gone and then coming bac
And so sort of had to you know build my trust with him again you know each tim
don't know if it was like Kmart or something like that you know big old you know store and was with him it was just the two of us because my mom had insisted that go with him you know to just have sort of some father daughter time gues
And um we had gone and he had he was looking at something and he told me he said Now stay right here and of course you know I'm only like three or somethin
And um so of course threeyearold is not going to stay right anywhere and just kind of you know wandered down the aisle looking at something else or may have turned the corner don't remembe
Well you know my dad wasn't in sight and of course you know panic hit you know threeyear old and you know start cryin
Well stock person or worker or somebody found me and took me up to the um to the desk and uh they were asking what my dad's name was or what he looked like and remember saying He's just baldheaded man named Ray And so they over the intercom they had to just say Would the bald headed man named Ray who owns little red headed girl please come to the service desk And so he had to come get me and was just absolutely mortifie
Here you know he had just gotten back in from you know out of the country and you know takes his daughter somewhere and then loses her and mean wouldn't get near hi
And remember getting home and oh mean was just bursting in the door just crying wanting my mam
Well she happened to be in the bathroom at the time taking bath and remember just bursting into the bathroom just sobbing and just Mama Daddy lost me Good morning everyon
And uh mean it was like weeks before would go anywhere with my dad again eve
mean was just convinced he was going to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere would be like No you're going to lose me again and you know it was just the longest time before ever trusted him enough to even go anywhere with hi
I'm here with Sean Jamieson he's going to be the third subject and I'm just making sure this recorder's working goo
OK we're here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the um project and Sean is from Chicago originall
And uh how would you describe your your accent the way you speak or To to well guess I of course don't think have an accen
Ah speak like ah everybody grew up speaks so speaks the same way but ah to the extent have one it's a would be Midwestern I think more generically Midwestern than specifically Chicag
Chicago to me sound is is more nasal and more pronounced and sounds like ah sounds surprisingly close to Chi New Yor
And and how about living in the South Do you think that's actually ah mean when if when you go back up North do people say Hey can tell you're picking up some y'alls' or something have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge have never knowingly used the term y'all But ah maybe maybe the words are slightly as far as you kno
They might be don't know ah you know the people hang out with in Charlotte by and large are are not Southerners because the people work with and the people who are my friends tend to be transplants as wel
The newspaper business recruits nationally and so the people work with are from all over the countr
And only minority guess are Southerners and uh my friends here are tend to be people from other places as well and rather than rather than ah Southerners or Charlotteans so don't ah I'm not although when I'm in the store and when I'm out and about in other places yeah hear the Southern accent but don't think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and and don't think I'm picking anything u
OK so and we're talking we're talking about um guess going back to Chicago and um your you want to talk about your family um on your dad's sid
 Trying trying to think of subject to talk about and I'm I'm not good at remembering storie
don't remember jokes and don't remember stories which is which says something about the way my brain works but do remember you know hearing about family history and such and and uh had asked about it since then to to figure out how everybody ah came to be in Canada which is where is where my dad's side of the family is from and my dad came down to the United States in the middle of the 60s when he was working for company in Guelph Ontario which is outside of Toronto and met my mom in at that time and he settled down they settled down in the Chicago suburbs and and spent their whole lives ther
My grandfather was born in Edinburgh Scotland and my grandmother was born in County Cork Irelan
They both immigrated well my grandmother immigrated to New York believe and then made her way up to Rhode Island where believe she worked as domesti
And my grandfather ran away from home as very young boy and became sailor and sailed back and fourth across the Atlanti
know that much and don't know where all else he sailed but ah eventually got tired of that and left his ship in New York and and was spending was in New York and this was guess about the time of WW
don't know if my dad's if I've ever if my dad's told me that don't recall exactly what it was and then my so my my grandfather was living in New York believe in an immigrant community in New York and the Canadian Army was recruiting from among immigrants because believe at the time the Canadians did not uh did not draft did not draft during WWI and try need but they needed to help the British fighting in Europe and so the they decided that good place to recruit would be among the immigrant communities in NY particularly among people who had immigrated from the British Isle
And the promise was that if you made it through the war you would have shot at some ah you know there would be money for you at the end ah you'd be able to settle in Canad
And so my grandfather joined the Brit and joined the Canadian army fought in France was wounded and eventually made his way back to guess New York and then up to Rhode Island where he met my grandmothe
don't know the exact sequence of events here but he met my grandmother and then moved to to ah Ontario Canada where He had farm waiting for him right Where he had a where he became tried to become farmer and this was an area about 60 miles southwest of Toronto in what at the time must have been pretty remote part of part of the provinc
Turns out he was not very successful as farmer and gave that up and moved into the city of Guelph which was decent sized free standing city outside of of Toronto but much smaller than Toronto and build house there and became did variety of jobs ah don't believe don't know if he had particular trade other than being sailor so he worked in variety of job
know during the Depression he worked as a as night watchman at factory and he was my dad talked about how he how my grandfather felt very fortunate that he didn't lose his job during the Depression that at least he was able to keep job all through the Depression working as night watchman and they built house which the family owns as of toda
In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old woodframed house on two lots and at the time this wasn't big deal but now it is there's about hundred yards of hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is private country club and very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuabl
At the time obviously it wasn't big deal to live on golf course and now it is so that that property is still in the family um as kid my used to go we used to go up there every year for family reunions we would ah drive from Chicago through Detroit up to Guelp
To the same house To the same house that my grandmother and grandfather had had built and uh attend the family reunion my dad was one of eight kids and guess six of them married and everybody had at least three kid
The number of kids that my aunts and uncles had varied guess from three to si
Typically about 75 to 80 people at each at each reunion which is held in August of every yea
Somebody has these numbers but I'm not sure but ah but my dad's my dad's siblings were so ah spread out in age they're at least 20 years at least 20 years from the oldest to the youngest so my oldest uncle had married fairly young he had fought in WWII and he was married during WWII and believe he and my aunt had their first child during the War and that that was cousin of mine named Dave who I oh when first met him and his wife thought they were my aunt and uncle but when got older realized that they're actually my first cousins they were just old enough to be my parents and so it seemed to me like they were too old to be cousins because the people associated with being my cousins were my age or relatively close to my age uh and they were large group of these kids but these other two were like um my parents' age and hanging out with my parents at the reunion and you know drinking beer under the tent and shooting the crap and just thought they were my aunt and uncle but they were actually my cousins uh and that was because It's like their ah dad's ah brother or sister beared children other Yeah exactly exactl
Right that was my dad's oldest brother and his wife's oldest kids so there was and then then there would be different people who would show up at different reunions so every year there would be people there who didn't know and then would we're fairly close relatives but didn't know who they were and so would always have to be asking or would kind of wait for an introduction of some sor
And it got even more confusing when my cousins got older and would bring girlfriends or boyfriends or spouses who never met before to oh the reunions and it all just ah so it's still uh these days was at one about two years ago reunion and there are still about 75 to 80 people who show up consistently every year although it's it's different group of people they'll be you know there's group of maybe 20 or 25 who don't come to every reunion like me but there'll be different 20 or 25 in ther
So the number of people who show up is pretty consistent it's just that the group changes somewhat from year to year as the people are are available to make the weekend or aren'
Um Is it every year they have the reunion Every year yeah we do reunion every yea
And it was was my my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the ah my grandparents' old house who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them going because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agend
So my aunt had been had been real smart about about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all ah kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives wer
So who's going to ah start doing that who's going to be coordinating that now that she's Ah one of my cousins apparently is well two of my cousins are are keeping it going in fac
just had phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and ah it's not clear who's going to host it but ah there's still quite large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting i
Ah the reason that one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had there are two small houses on four big lots on this deadend street so there was lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out put up couple of tents or shelters or whatever have barbecue grills out there and uh couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom whatever so there's just lot of room and uh but it's not clear if that house is going to be sold or not now that my aunt has ah passed awa
Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a ah couple of my aunts and it's not clear if family member is going to buy the house and sort of keep it in the family or what's going happen to it but I'm hoping that they keep it because it's it's ah there's so many family members there that you think somebody would want to hang on to it and it's such nice set up with really sort of an extended family that always sort of lived right on this block and uh I'm thinking would probably want to keep hang on to the hous
How many of your um um guess that's these are all the ah brothers and sisters of your your dad Of my dad yea
How many of them live in is it Guelph It's the name of the city is Guelp
There is let's see I've got an aunt and an uncle and two of their kids are still ther
I I'm running out of fingers here but ah and then an aunt or ah a cousin and his wife and their three kids and let's see that's about dozen people right there that can think of off the top of my head and then quite few cousins and their and their families and kids are in the Toronto area some of some of them have moved away and come back ah but everybody most of them have sort of settled in and around the Toronto area in the suburbs in one direction or anothe
Oh there's in fact there's cousin and her husband and their ah their six kids who just moved back to Guelph after having been ah ah his business had taken him away for couple of years but now they're back in Guelph so that's number si
So I'd say there must be at least 20 uh immediate relatives that are still living in Guelp
Um now how big of city is that want to say it's 90 or 100 thousand or something like tha
There's couple of other cities of similar size nearby so it's almost getting to be like its own metropolitan area small metro are
So it's um almost like you'll you'll meet ah if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know Jamieson ther
Yeah yeah because some of like my aunt who just died was bookkeeper who worked at lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious so think she was probably on first name basis with awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend everybody's your neighbor and even people that ah should be fairly casually she'd greet those people by name and know little bit about them ah and so yeah she's ah and my cousin one of my cousins has couple of businesses in town and think is relatively wellknown is on some sort of city board or something like tha
Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough think that you would run into decent number of people who would know Jamieson or tw
And then ah guess the family reunion is when is the next one you're going to go to It's August 12th of this year August 12th of 2000 and uh don't know don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to g
went couple of years ago and didn't make it last year and I'm I'm now I'm kind of sorry didn't because my aunt passed away in the meantime and knew she was in poor health last yea
It's they're starting to get up there and and lifetime of bad eating habits is starting to catch up although my aunt was about 75 when she when she died so she had a she had long ru
She was yeah right up right up to the day ah when she fell and think she fell and broke her hip if recall what put her in the hospita
She was ah think she was ah downtown think she had taken the bus or cab downtown and had uh met with her lady friends to have lunch or somethin
She did almost every day and recall that she slipped and fell and then as happens with lot of older people developed complications while she was in the hospital and ah never never recovered unfortunatel
It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just it is I I'm sure you know older people who've had that happen to them you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just um um didn't make it unfortunatel
It sounds like big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you've got somebody that's going to take over and start putting that back together ther
You can you can probably add whole chapter in the report of my use of the word matriarc
I'm not sure if said ah Sean's name but this is Sean Jamieson from Charlotte and um and uh you know he's the third um subjec
Is it And uh think we did little background on your dialect or how you think you spea
Last summer over the Fourth of July our family decided to take vacation We decided to go to Myrtle Beach S
They were cooped; they didn't like being cooped up in their seat belts so we had to stop quite ofte
We walked for about thirty minutes and then came back and sat on the beach After we sat on the beach we decided that we should get ready to go out to dinner After we got ready to go about to dinner we drove around looking for restauran
We ate until we were all stuffed After we ate dinner we decided to go and play some games in the arcad
We kept stalling and bumping and going around in circles and we just had wonderful time on the bumper cars By then we decided we should go back to the roo
It wasn't that late it was only about nine o'clock so we decided to get some flashlights and go for walk on the beac
We got about ten sand crabs in bucket and then decided to let them all g
It was great night just to sit and relax The next day we got up around nine o'clock and decided to go sit out and play on the beac
We put one boy in one hole and the other one in the other hole and we covered them all the way up to their shoulders and their heads were just sticking ou
We decided to just leave them there for while because they couldn't get into any trouble They finally got themselves out of their deep holes and they went in the ocean and took some rafts and tried to ride the wave
So we sat around and ate hotdogs and milkshakes and then went back out in the sand for while longer took nap and my husband and the boys played Frisbe
It was the Fourth of July; so we decided that we should get off the beach for while and let the kids take res
After their rest we decided to eat dinner out on on the beach at little restaurant they had nice little ban
We sat around and listened to music and then decided it was time for us to let some of our own firecrackers of
was afraid was going to step on hot firecracker because they were all over the plac
It was just Bang Bang Bang But they were really pretty and it was wonderful evening We took walk on the beach and so we could see some more firework
We were going to have to leave the next day so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon and late in the afternoon we decided that we had better get on the roa
They slept in the car all the way back and that is the story about our long weekend vacation during the Fourth of Jul
Well worked as police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and half years until recentl
And I'll tell the story of one of my chases and if that doesn't go enough time I'll tell the story of another chase vehicle chas
Um one night after had arrested my second DWI took the DWI down to the intake center that's the jail in downtown took him down to the jail and him processed and got him i
And about at probably Idlewild Rd no probably at Albemarle Rd got in behind uh this is still in Charlotte so it wasn't in my jurisdiction got in behind uh an old like '69 or '70 Oldsmobile Cutlass that had paper ta
did did notice it and that it had paper tag and that it was primer primer black black prime
And which you can track them but it's real hard to because it's so it's common to switch the
And I we we were headed outbound on highway on Independence Blvd Highway 74 and noticed he was running about 50 miles an hour 50 5
So got in behind him or not behind him but was in the lane beside of him and he was little bit ahead of me for the turn for the vehicle was little ahead of m
And so sped up to 60 just to see what he was doing just to kind of let him know Hey you're speeding you kno
And and we we're still headed outbound we cross over um we cross over Idlewild and um no actually no this is right prior to Idlewild and he's running 60 miles an hou
And um got on the radio with Charlotte thinking he might be impaired or you know drunk or something like tha
And as I'm going down the road 65 miles an hour see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of uh um that shopping area right right prior to Conferenc
And try to tell Charlotte that we just passed an officer and needless to say uh they didn't get up with hi
And um we pass um we pass uh uh the car dealerships on our left hand sid
And so went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews he's getting blue lighte
And so we're running 70 probably 70 good 70 miles an hour and we go we pass over Sardis North and right as we get into Matthews about where uh Crown Point Executive Dr is I uh told them was initiating sto
So flipped on my blue lights and it was on He took off and was running about 90 miles an hour and I'm right in behind him um I'm keeping radio contact with um with dispatch and the other unit
And um Rich Brian Rich evidently came up uh Sam Newell and got in behind m
We're running we're heading past we're probably at at the Pep Boys now maybe where the Boston Market i
Um we got up to the fastest we got up to on 74 was about 11
And um he's still getting on along and uh I'm still sticking with him and felt uncomfortable on the wet road
And um my sergeant of course was asking me during the chase that's uh Sergeant Stevens was making sure that the traffic was was OK and that felt OK with the chas
And the the the what the driver was doing you know keeping up with all the locations and landmarks which I do pretty well; was ready with tha
Independence and Winter Square Dr And they'd say 10four Independence and Winter Square Dr And said Still continuing eastbound on Highway 74 And um so we're running we're booking on along about 110 or so and say uh Headquarters the roads are we
I'm going to go ahead and 22 the chase 1022 is Disregard the Chase' you know go ahead and and let bac
The minute you call 10 43 basically all radio traffic ceases and you are the you're the main perso
Rich evidently had gotten in behind me and 22'ed the chase probably about the Highway 51 bridge maybe little past i
And so as I'm backing off I'm I'm still keeping an eye on him if he's slowing down little bit and he goes to highway to MatthewsMint Hill and 74 makes left hand tur
And so went ahead and uh got back in the chase again because figured um you know just figured I'd go ahead go ahead and chase him because knew that he couldn't keep up that kind of speed on the uh on the MatthewsMint Hil
And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down MatthewsMint Hill we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hou
We get to uh Providence or uh I'm sorry we get to Highway 51 to MatthewsMint Hill and he makes that right turn and he slows down for that and so I'm right in behind him blue lights and sirens all the wa
And uh we're heading out on Idlewild Rd we're or we're on 51 MatthewsMint Hill both being the same no
We get to the Petro we get to the Petro now the BP station at Idlewild and 51 he makes right heading towards Union Count
And uh so we start heading down that way and uh we're going on down Idlewild Rd keep right on going cross over 485 construction which it was under construction at that point and um we're we're running good cli
And uh by that time what had done was you know at about 51 or so had switched over was talking to Charlotte Mecklenburg and the Highway Patrol on my main car radio and talking to Matthews dispatch on my hand held as as I'm drivin
Um Rich Brian Rich is still behind me and as we didn't have our new radio tower up had we had the radio tower up would be able to maintain contact with Matthews on my handheld but the handhelds don't transmit very wel
Um so mean was still maintaining contact and they could still hear me on uh Mutual Aid but the thing was should have been on Matthews uh main channel on my car radio because it transmits stronge
Uh Brian's still behind me and um so I'm getting on with the Highway Patrol trying to have the Highway Patrol come and and meet with me because we're heading towards Union Count
Not that can't chase into Union county but I'd much rather have the Highway Patrolman out there myself because they'll ram somebody off the road in heart beat Not really but uh they're better at chases; they've had training in chase
And um so we start going over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses m
I'm still maintaining contact with with Highway Patrol and uh they're hearing me fine and uh they're trying to get somebody out there to m
But as we down to we're heading we're getting into Union County good ways and we get down to we cross over Stevens Mill and there's the next road pass Steven's Mill think it's Union Mill or Indian Trail Rd I'm not exactly sur
They lost me and I'm still transmitting on Mutual Aid because didn't see any units around me and knew we were headed towards Highway Patrol station because they're down there on Seacrest Short Cut and pretty soon Unionville Rd or Idlewild think turns into Seacrest Short Cut believ
And uh so my sergeant gets on the radio and says uh you know 321 if you can copy m
22 your chase 22 your chase And so disregarded my chase and parked at the BP station and uh advised Highway Patrol that was being 22'ed by my sergean
And uh so parked there and kind of calmed down for few minutes and here comes Rich and here comes Sergeant Steven
And so he both pulls in they both pull in you know and let them know that lost him and then Highway Patrolman comes up and uh asks Which way did he go and say He went down that way And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying trying to catch up to the gu
My best guess is what he did was when 22'ed he probably took side road and uh headed headed out into the county somewher
Probably what had happened was his license was revoked or he was DWI or something like that and uh but but the whole thing about it was had maintained contact with Matthews on my main radio we would have probably caught him or at least been able to get the Highway Patrol up there and they could have assumed the chas
And of course would have to have been the secondary unit because I started the chas
So Did you get into trouble No Harris just told me Next time be on your radio And Glenn one of the dispatchers up there he goes We didn't have to do anythin
Uh you were contacting Highway Patrol and you were contacting us and basically you were doing our job for us But knew that was wrong thing to d
Pat said he was just afraid that had uh that had wrecked or something like tha
That was you know in the woods somewhere up against tree in my patrol car after running 90 miles an hour down Idlewild Rd as it gets curv
When was three years old my family and moved to Myrtle Beach SC from Woonsocket RI and when was younger guess about seven eight nine years old every Christmas my family and would go to visit our relatives in Woonsocket and we usually left on the 22nd of December and remember it being really long car ride 16 hours and my sister my younger sister who was four years younger than me would often fight in the back seat and when we got there um we would stay in hotel called the Suisse Chalet and it was in Smits Smithfield RI which was about 20 minutes away from Woonsocket where my relatives were from and in Woonsocket we would visit both my sets of grandparents who lived there and it's tradition in my family that on Christmas Eve we would eat dinner at um my grandparents house on my mom's side and my grandmother would cook huge dinner Christmas dinner and Christmas Eve dinner and we would open one of our Christmas presents which thought was great tradition and it's tradition that we still practice to this day and usually on New Year's Day my mother's family had tradition of renting hall or restaurant bar that was sort of reunion um so that we could see all of our relatives and remember spending time with my cousins who Stacy and Stephanie who were about my ag
Um at the time when was sophomore in college at Notre Dame decided to go on Spring Break which happened around late March and decided to go to Boca Raton FL with my best friend from high schoo
And so um we met in FL and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night uh Boca Raton and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned hotel called The Sanddollar in place called Lauderdale by the Sea um in Fort Lauderdale and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner remember going to Benihana Japanese steakhouse and we just felt like we had freedom and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale so we basically spent our time uh watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and remember going out for ice cream one night and just walking along the boardwalk it was very very peaceful time and the worst part of the vacation was getting sunburned um because I'm extremely pale and going out on the beach everyday for hours on end turned me into lobster and um my friend Crystal would always joke with me and call me um her lobste
One of my best friends growing up um was named Bonnie Martin and met her when was in fourth grade at S
Andrew's Catholic School and we became friends um almost immediately because we learned that we lived close to one another and it was about maybe the second or third week of school when she invited me to her house and she lived um in an oceanfront house and uh we went um we spent the day watching TV watching General Hospital which was both of are favorite shows and we would walk on the beach and we would play with her dog and then we would walk down to the pond and feed the ducks and we would ride our bicycles all around the neighborhoo
It was an afternoon in January and there was no school that day and my mom told me that my grandfather who lived in RI had died and guess at the time wasn't able to deal with my emotions or that was in denial that it happened and remember just running away to my best friend Bonnie's house and not even telling my mom or my dad where was going and got to her house and told my friend what had happened and she could tell that was really upset about it and so just felt I'd just run awa
We went on our bicycles and we told pretty much the whole way and guess that her mom Dottie had called my mom and told her that was OK because I'm sure that she was worrie
You know all of sudden ran out of the house with no explanation but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend and didn't want to be alone and it was really good experienc
Andrew's and we became friends when was in fifth or sixth grade and she lived across the street from me and loved to go to her house because she had pool and my parents did no
And so would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings and usually would spend the night and um so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun and she had an older sister named Tina and it was in high school and we were in grade school at the time and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess jeans and the jean jackets and the cute you know skirts and tops and don't know what happened to our friendship Maria and min
few years later when was in eighth grade we got into fight at school involving another girl in our class and don't even remember what the fight was over and it seemed like silly reason at the tim
And what's amazing is that we didn't talk for at least three or four years um because of that fight and it was sad for me because she lived across the street and felt like couldn't talk to her anymore and it was only our senior year in high school that um we finally were able to patch things u
She her locker was next to mine and remember one day we just said Hi to each other for the first time after ignoring each other for the entire year and um it was liberating it was great that we could finally talk and make up and since then um you know we've kept in touch when we were both in college and ran into her here in Charlotte about couple of weeks ag
Gabriel's Catholic Church here in Charlotte and it was neat to see her here because didn't realize she had moved to Charlott
Resident with me and the most from my childhood was ah the story about my grandmothe
My mother I'm I'm from Charlotte and my mother was from here as well she died in 1992 yeah December 1992 and she the only girl of 10 kid
Uh but one of the stories uh my grandmother was born in 1898 yeah 1898 and she lived to be ah 10
So um my mother grew up out near the airport near in the Steele Creek community and um my grandmother for all those years all the 20th century basically lived out in the country until the last three years of her lif
But she had her leg amputated so she moved in with us and we took care of he
Uh but before that she was in the country and so my mom use to talk about how as the only girl she would have to wash dishes and do the domestic things so even at dinner Sunday dinner if their were chicken if they had fried chicken my mother had to wait for her brothers to eat the choice pieces of chicken and then she could eat wing or back or neck and to the day she died that's how she wa
So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny uh had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then you're talking oh probably 1930s early 1930s uh my mother would've been 10 or 12 somewhere around there and Granny uh went to the train track to get on the little trolley train whatever they had at that time to come downtow
Well during her absence my mom was suppose to clean the house and probably prepared dinner and stuff like tha
Well after about don't know about two hours two and half hours think my mom said Granny came back and she was quite upse
One Mama hadn't done any work she was suppose to do and she got beat down all right and two Granny had sat about two hours at the um train stop and she hadn't noticed the tracks had been move
So there was no longer train that ran there and so don't know what the um don't know what the rationale was for all of tha
guess they just changed the route and what not but uh she laughed about that all the time my mom did she didn't laugh at the time she was getting beat ah but she use to always tell us that was really the only time that she got beat  Uhhu
by Granny and and she never beat her boys because her boys could did no wrong in her min
And then hum there's another story well this is a this is not a this is not story she passed down this is story of mine gues
Now bear in mind that told you Granny moved in with us um towards the later years of her life and when she moved in with us was in the 10th grade so was just starting high schoo
Well standard procedure back then don't know what it is now is that you come in someone comes in and they give you now don't if it's like this now but back then they would give you bag of prophylactics condoms all righ
Now my mother never drove her entire life she never drove so took her wherever she wen
And so this Sunday morning we had eaten breakfast and we're getting Granny situated in her wheelchair and everything and that was pretty much my job and told my mom and my sister to go out to the car and open the trun
Oh my goodness something's happened Mama Come back here I'm thinking they found dead dog or you know something in the driveway backyar
Then Mama goes uh Oh Lord help me say What is the problem And so Jeff Jeff get out here right now mean everybody in the neighborhoo
Something's wrong but let's go on out and I'll get you situated in the car And um get her in there and around to the bac
Explain this and said Explain what just told you to open the trunk Well low and behold the condoms which are multicolored had fallen out the ba
I'm like Well I'm speechless what am going to say they already convicted me now my mother and my siste
So needless to say that that ride to church was very quiet and they said Excuse me this afternoon you and your nephews my sister's kids who are my age uh we're going to have talk after dinner And so we had the birds and the bees talk after dinne
Now remember my mother was at that point at that point she was probably she had me when she was 46 so she was close to 60 yeah she was close to 60 at that poin
Now of course my dad never talked to me about any of that stuff but that's another stor
But they were just convinced that they were getting ready to just ruin our lives but some women were going get us to do some stuff they didn't need to do and we were going be some baby's daddy and Lord and that's my story in terms of um um something we still laugh about my sister and I yea
Well my grandmother who's your greatgrandmother used to be able to tell me lot of you know lot stories that happened in her family and since was history major in college and was studying and was studying about formation of unions and so forth particularly in the South thought this one was really interesting but it's really two stories in on
And it was back during the 1930s and you know the country was in depression and my grandmother and my mom lived with her mm lived with lived with her mother and fathe
In other words my mom's grandmother which would be my great grandmother your great great grandmothe
believe it was woolen mill because in SC oh in lot of parts of the Carolinas there were lot of different types of mills cotton mills woolen mill
And at that time there was movement to unionize and most of the mill owners and managers and so forth were against unions at that tim
And um not only was he over that mill but they he also owned or co owned or rented or something some small houses some small guess we would probably call them shanty type houses cause they were very smal
Ah and they were used by some of the you know some some of the black people and some of the white people in this little small tow
And um anyway there was this big push to unionize and guess my uncle my grandfather was great grandfather was trying to be openminded about the whole thing but apparently there were some real problems and one afternoon one of the uh union organizers who was from Union who was actually citizen because they had brought because lots of times they brought in people from the North to help form these union
And uh this guy was actually from Union was actually neighbor but he had history of mental problem
And uh this afternoon he that afternoon he came over and got very guess he was very demanding and uh was guess he was also acting very strang
For whatever reason he shot and killed my great grandfather over union issue in his front yard in my grandfather's front yard and my mother and grandmother and great grandmother all witnessed i
And the guy was never charged with murder or anything because he was so mentally unstabl
So he was just you know trotted off to mental institution for the rest of his lif
But the one thing about it was that my great grandmother who was very strong woman knew OK knew that all these people all these people depended on my grandfather for different things and um even when times were really bad my grandfather would great grandfather would help you know some of these really poor people out and there was this one couple this one guy who was just really hard worker really nice person but he was having really hard time and so my grand great grandmother and my great grandfather took great big anonymously took great big basket of food to their door and he knew that they would never take this stuff from anyone that they knew was one of those real proud people and so they took it like late at night and right before they put it down my grandmother my grandfather slipped 50 bucks which was lot of money back in those days into the baske
Well the thing about it was in I'm sort of telling this story out of order but my grand after my grandfather died and my great grandmother was sort of alone um it must have been right around Thanksgiving and she was feeling real depressed or whatever and this lady came and invited her to come to dinner and when she and so my grandmother didn't think she really wanted to go and everything but she thought Well OK she'd go ahead and g
When she went all these people all these different people from all over the place she said half of them you know guess they back then guess they called them vagabond
lot of them were just I or what we would call guess homeless people but they were also people that they knew were ther
And so my grandmother was talking to this lady saying they couldn't believe that she had prepared this mea
It must've been Thanksgiving this meal for all these people and that she didn't know and some of them she did know and the lady said well she said well what happened was several years back when she in her husband were having such horrible time one night they got great big basket of food that had 50 dollars in i
And she said and that tied them over for the longest time and they never found out who it wa
And they thought well once they got on their feet if they could repay people someho
This is what they would do and so they you know every time this time of year or whatever they would have this meal and guess you know she's just hoping that some day she would pay back the person perhaps that had given them that money because she didn't know who it wa
And she didn't know if it was friend or stranger and this way they invited friends and stranger
And so she said that was why they had this meal every year between it must be between Christmas and Thanksgiving or something like tha
And so my grandmother told me that and uh I thought it was just really nice way that this woman had had actually she didn't know it but had repaid her kindness because it had been my great grandmothe
But my great grandmother never told her that she was the one and yet at that time that lady was inviting my grandmother great grandmother over to this dinner and everything um anonymousl
And just thought it was just really cute or not cute but really sweet way to be thankful this time of yea
Is that it OK this is my third interview with my friend Tabatha Lloyd who also lives in Lincolnton NC where liv
Have you lived here all your life Tabatha Yes all but six months and we moved to Robinsvill
And where is Robinsville Um it's at the tip of North Carolina and Tennessee it's in North Carolina but it touches Tennesse
Can you tell us little bit about it Um yeah both my mother and my father's family all live there and um my mother and my father moved here with Duke Power um in about '7
guess they moved to South Carolina first and then my dad was transferred here and the so the rest of our family lives there um and we're the only people who live here and it's just total redneck tow
What Lincolnton or Robinsville Robinsville um what why is it redneck guess well the whole town consists of nothing but white people and Indian
Um the only chain that is in the whole town is an Ingle's grocery store we used to have Hardee's but they took it ou
We do have Papa's Pizza now and the rest of it is just all familyowned businesse
If you want to go shopping you have to go about thirty miles other than grocery store um you have to everybody goes to Asheville to shop because there's no there's no stores to shop there except for just like familyowned little clothing stores and stuff stuff nobody want
Isn't that where they filmed the movie Nell and weren't your grandparents part of that film No they they did film the movie Nell there but um they the pool hall was my uncle's pool hall that it was filmed in but no my grandparents had nothing to do with i
Um my uncle did rent out his pool hall and in the grocery store scene my aunt and my cousin are in the grocery store scene and guess that's all the family members have in ther
They've totally all the tourists have destroyed the house the little cabin in the woods where Nell was filme
Um they've just went up there and took planks of wood and stuff off of it and totally destroyed the whole plac
Do you like living in Lincolnton and the people here as opposed to the people in Robinsville do you think they're nicer um mean friendlier and just in general do you like living in this area Uh wouldn't live anywhere but Lincolnton don't thin
Th like say there's no you can't go shopping or anything so there's lot of family time spent you know you there's lot a lot of visiting and people take time for each other up there there's not the hustle and bustle that's down here so life's lot slower pace ther
What about Lincolnton Life's definitely fast paced here because everybody's always busy an nobody visits anybody we just don't have any of the old the old school tactics guess that uh they practice in Robinsvill
Wow and this is considered small town to lots of people who might live in larger areas like even Gast Charlott
Yeah Charlotte uh did you like going to Lincolnton High School Um no it pretty well no Lincolnton High School pretty well sucke
Um think made it there like seventyfive days out of my senior year and still managed to graduate with my class with plus averag
Um OK well so do you think you'll ever want to travel or and if you do where do you want to travel to would like to go to Scotland know Scotland and Ireland um just because think the think the land's beautiful like the accent and just think it would be neat place to g
I'm not really Paris Europe doesn't really drill me um I'd like to go to Scotland and Ireland and of course the Bahamas or Hawaii everybody wants to go there but that's um guess Scotland would just be the place I'd most like to g
OK um your mom also lives here in Lincolnton and I've never known a family and I'm talking about you your sister and your mom and your brother who is more close in such functional yet dysfunctional wa
Tell me little bit about your mom and the things that you appreciate in her or things that you remember about her best when you were younge
Um we are really close and guess that's because my mom was single mother who raised u
She had to work two and three jobs our whole life to take care of u
So growing up she wasn't really around much um but she's always been our best frien
Um my sister's just always kind of she's the middle child and she's always just kind of took care of me and my brothe
And um I'm the baby so momma just always left everything up to Tonya to take care of us and that's why guess we're so close because we all had to depend on each other and we didn't depend on anybody else to take care of u
We're we're all best friends and it's kind of hard for other people to fit in you know it's the four of us and then everybody else gues
OK and what about your dad do you know you're not as close with your dad as your mom even though you do love him um do you remember your mom and dad being together when you were child and you know holidays or anything like that that you remember them being together don't don't remember how young you were whenever they got divorce
Um remember Christmas some Christmases with my dad um because remember one Christmas we got every we always got everything on Christmas Eve because my mom couldn't wai
Um and remember the day that um was five years old and was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasn't coming home and um it was the summer before went in kindergarte
And was sitting in my dad's chair waiting on him to come home and uh my uh momma told me daddy wasn't coming home but uh that's really the only two things remember about my daddy being young uh remember one other night with uh when he took my brother and sister to a um race car um race or something but stayed at home with my mom and that's really the only three times that remember my dad before they split u
And as for my dad you know he's great guy love him but he's set in his ways and he's always right he's never wrong and you know I'm too much like my mom so we're not the best of friends but that's my da
OK Tabatha um we spent lot of time together when we were younger um lot of good times lot of fun time
What are the now that we're both two old married women what are some of the things that you remember and miss about our younger days especially our years in high school when we had to kind of rely on each other as nonconformists to the groups in Lincolnton High Schoo
Um guess miss going to church together because you know we were always in the same youth grou
And of course miss Galen Radebaugh but um definitely do not miss the short period of time that had to live with yo
Alynne was crazy and speaking of my dysfunctional family my my brother was in love with Alynne and my brother's girlfriend wanted to kill Alynne and Alynne was crazy and probably on Prozac and Alynne tries to kill herself you know as we hear she she's constantly trying to kill herself and she contributes all her problems to the fact that my brother don't know that she wasn't with my brother gues
But Alynne thought she had beautiful feet and she thought that she was holier than thou and she she was just spoiled bra
Um Golly Besides Alynne can you remember any fun things that we did together Fun thing What were the funnest memorie
know know remember staying at your house spending the night ordering pizza whenever we didn't have any money to do so and having to steal money from your brother or just Count out chang
count out pennies and going swimming at the hotel where your mom use to work at night when nobody was there and we weren't really allowed to be there that was fu
Um guess don't know just hanging out um we use to hang out with like Steven Waite
We use to just hang out and have good time all the time we stayed with each other all the time and um  You taught me how to smok
Um guess the funnest times we ever had would have to say was right after me and Doug got married but I'm not going to talk about that so um don't kno
Th that was the really memorable times um seeing who could stand outside the longest on the deck in the snow Oh remember that that was fu
It was never about partying mean we did party especially after you and Doug got married but it was never about tha
think when we had our funnest times mean those times were fun but we also when when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too so we didn't Did you go to the beach with us Fort Caswell yeah O
Like lot of my other friends in high school all we did was like party together and that's the only memories have of them when ever want to remember something about them it's always OK well we did we drank that night and did this that night But with you and you and just and maybe one or two of my other friends from high school really we really had friendship that didn't involve stuff like that all the tim
But digress I'm sorry anyway Um I've been asked asked dad and Linda the same question because it's such cheesy question but I'm going to go ahead and ask you since we're coming upon the year two thousand what was your favorite movie of all time and why Um guess it would d d da da da da da probably Dirty Dancin
 I just love Dirty Dancing and um it wasn't because thought Patrick Swayze was beautiful or anything it was because really don't think he's that good looking just the story was sweet and it was good stor
always needed that older man to come take me away Doug took me right here to uh Lincolnto
Um and if it was Up Close and Personal it would be totally because of Robert Redford standing at the end of the escalato
Um speaking of Doug you guys have been together for how many years not not just including the years you've been marrie
Um do you remember the very first time you ever saw or um met Doug in high school and can you talk about that little bit The first time ever met Doug was at church was at Covenant and he came to church with friend of ours Tammy Taylor and um he um he had don't remember if he had mohawk then or if he was baldheaded I'm guessing he probably had mohawk and had on green and brown flannel shirt would guess and he weighed hundred and twenty six pounds and was six four he looked like he was dying with AIDS he was pathetic looking felt so sorry for him and he was total freak he did not talk to anybody he was just skater and he was just total frea
And decided was going to be his friend and talked to him at church but he was Uh uh was all he would ever sa
And then finally we had class together when moved and because switched schools in tenth grade and when moved to Lincolnton um well to Lincolnton High School had class with hi
And um he the way we started talking is he had shaved his head bald and he was going to let some of the guys draw picture on his head with black magic marker and felt sorry for him and told him that they were not going to draw on his head and we just started datin
And the first time he ever called me was on the phone and he called was talking to my mom and switched over and I'm like MAMA IT'S DOUG and he said Huh had forgotten to switch the phone over before screamed in his ea
Were you excited that it was Doug or horrified was very excited um liked him lot though just think really really felt sorry for him and just wanted to kind of take care of him and now he takes care of m
And um you were talking earlier about being friends um one thing think through being friends through the years and stuff and uh not all being about partying is we have friendship that we think we'll always be friends whether we're always together or not you know It's not a it's not about you know seeing each other every day or hanging out all the time its deeper than that and think that's because God's at the root of i
Um oh wanted to ask you about your know you love kids and you've always worked with kids since you've been out of high school you've wanted to pursue career with child care development and why do you like kids because don't see why but uh maybe you can explain to us why you like them so muc
don't know I've always liked kids guess because I've guess it has lot to do with the fact that was the baby of the family and I've always you know was always just the kid of the whole family and um there was times that you know my dad wasn't around or whatever and just there were times he didn't treat me like he should have guess and just wanted to be good to kids and just want to show kids love and even if they have dysfunctional families or if things aren't the way that they should be that's that they have somewhere to go and somebody who loves them and um you know its not just kids it's you know it's teenagers have heart for teenagers and though sometimes that's got me in trouble still have heart for them and still you know someday really want to help teenagers as well as childre
Um OK it's very understandable why seeing it from that perspective why you like kids so muc
Um OK one of our favorite things to do is to tell ghost stories and scare the heebiejeebies out of each other um tell me one of your favorite ghost storie
You have friend Jennifer who lived like way out in the boon docks and some scary stuff occurred at her trailer can you tell us little bit about tha
Yeah well um had OK Jennifer I it been like couple days about week or so and hadn't had time to go up and see her and spent whole lot of time with her and her kids this is before got married so you know spent the night with her lot and um we we were friends and went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldn't go to sleep by his self and had worked all day so was really tired and went and laid down with him and me and him fell aslee
Well Jennifer came back there and she woke me up and um she said Tabatha and I'm like Um huh and she's like Tabatha get up and spend some time with me you hadn't you know hadn't seen you all week please get up and talk to me for little while and was real sleepy and I'm like OK Jennifer Well opened my eyes and like tossed my head over to look at Spencer when opened my eyes she was going back down the hall tossed my head back over to look at Spencer because he was laying on the other side of the bed and uh when did Jennifer was in the bed with me and Spencer she was laying down between me and Spencer or on the other side of Spencer Spencer was in between us and woke her up I'm like Jennifer you got to wake up now because and told her what had happened and that hadn't been the only time something like that had happened um there had been times when um we were like we were going to sleep or something and um one night I'd spent the night with her and some stuff had happened that night forget what all had happened but   Didn't you stay the night with her lot because her husband worked at night or something  Uh yeah he worked third shift and um she didn't like staying by herself because you know stuff did happen lot in that house but uh spent the night with her one night and Patrick w was actually home that night and s some stuff had happened you know we'd heard some noises and stuff and she'd ask me if would come sleep in their room she's like I'll make you pallet at the end of our bed just come in there you know um um I'm scared so I'm like OK Jennifer and she made me pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed and Jennifer said Tabatha hope that was you and said no was hoping that that was one of y'all and she said No it came from down there and said No it came from up ther
Well she looked at the clock and she's like Tabatha get up get up now and come in the living room and we went in the living room and sh and I'm like What Jennifer you know wanted to go to sleep and um she said Did you see what time it was And said No didn't see what time it was and she said It was 215 well at the time that meant nothing to me but um she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors and then it really started making sense to me and speaking of Amityville Horrors my house looks just like the house in Amityville Horrors have you ever looked at it Yea
Um but uh um and th then some other weird stuff happened and really think the reason that such weird stuff happened there was because was the only Christian influence in her life and think you know really believe that her house was possessed and believe that you know they probably wanted to get rid of me bu
Um um he one day her little boy who was about three years old um his grandpa's his grandpa's father was dead and well by that time his grandpa's mother and father was dead but one time he was talking to Jennifer's mom and it was Jennifer's momma's daddy whose father and mother were dea
OK so Spencer was talking to his grandmother and he told his grandmother he said I know he said Your grandpa's crying She said My grandpa's crying my grandpa's hey you know my grandpa's gone He said But he was crying and he was running through the woods and um u
Debbie asked Spencer she's like Spencer you know what are you talking about Spencer had never heard about this and um he said He's crying and he's running from somebody and she said Who's he running from And um um and Spencer said I don't know but he's crying he's running through the woods and she he said and she shot hi
And um Jennifer's grand uh Spencer's grandma asked Who shot him And said h his wife shot him and her um her grandpa had been shot and killed but they had never found out who had shot him they never knew who had killed hi
And then Spencer was three years old he had never heard it heard them talk about it before so mean he just knew and Spencer would sit like he would be sitting in the living room lot of times too and he would just look off into space and he would just get terrified and start screaming and he would run to you and just cry and would be still be looking at whatever he was just off in space like something was just scared him to deat
And um there was another one was just thought about oh horror stories oh Jennifer always told me also about this um this woman who she got this call one and she it it was this little boy and he said Um I'm lost and can't find my way home and can you call my mommy And and um the lady said um you know Yeah I'll call your mommy do you know your mommy's phone number And he um s he gave he gave um the lady his his phone number and he she said Well where are you so can tell your mommy where to come get you at and the little boy gave her the address of where he was and said Please call my momm
Well the lady called the little boy the number that the little boy had given her and um the the lady answered the phone or believe it was her husband actually who answered the phone and um the the lady said Ma'am um your little boy called here tonight and she said Your little boy just called your little boy said that he was lost and that he couldn't find his way home and he gave me the address of where he was and he wants y'all to come and get him And the lady said Ma'am and the lady got really mad and she was really angry and she said My little boy's dead and cannot believe that you would pull this joke on me and the lady said Ma'am your little boy just called here and you know would not play this joke on you And she said Let me give you the address of where he said he was because you know would not make this up And she gave the address and the lady went she gave the address and um the lady told her she said That's the house we lived in where my little boy got killed at or not had killed but think he had died in that house or whatever and um so um the little boy guess was just looking for his way hom
But um just wanted to mention again that that was Tabatha Lewis Lloyd sorry I'm use to calling her Tabatha Lewis from Lincolnton North Carolin
Fortunately I'm able to to pinpoint one that happened to me because it happened in the recent history of my lif
To give you little bit of brief history came out of the 80s like lot of people did kind of floundering trying to figure out some new direction
I'd been through lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life and course I'm sure my my mental frame but everything settled down and was going along had good job was dating lad
I've been member out there for quite some time primarily playing men's doubles and men's single
Played lot more men's singles in the 80s than did in the 90s; as we had gotten older we seemed to migrate more towards men's double
Had group of guys that played tennis with on Monday nights and at the time Thursday nights and Saturday and Sunday afternoons for quite some tim
On one particular Monday night we were playing mixed doubles played against played beside rather group of women all of whom knew and we'd kind of kidded because this was group of very attractive women three of whom knew but the fourth one didn't kno
Like say was playing with some friends of mine and and was literally smitten almost like sixteenyearold by this new woman so much so to where it was very very difficult for me focus on my game that day and was pretty much a weak link in the match for that entire perio
Well could never catch the eye of this new player so the match was over their match was over they left left and just kind of went on with my lif
Well few weeks after that ran into one of the other ladies there who along with her husband were friends of mine and asked her who that person wa
And she told me who she was; she said her name is Sally Trull she lives in Gastonia she's married mean she's uh divorced and has three childre
And she said And she's looking for somebody who plays tennis and has sense of humor And said Well that would definitely be me however at the time was dating someone and didn't think too terribly much about i
Well low and behold several weeks later received call from this lady asked me if wanted to play mixed doubles on Friday nigh
However our club closes on Friday nights so she wasn't able to get in which wasn't that much of hindranc
The real hindrance was the fact that she had left her tennis shoes under her desk at work so he she had showed up to play tennis with all of her equipment her racket and no shoes which is just very very bad combinatio
Of course she at the time was living in Gastonia and really didn't know her way around Charlotte very much at al
We were at our tennis club which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center it's really not all that terribly convenien
And in the 15 to 20 minute ride to Omega Sports as well as the 15 to 20 minute ride back from Omega Sports we both gave each other very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was going on and and the type person that we wer
It was very informative to me could feel very very strong attraction to Sally but knew had this other relationship going on um and didn't really want to do anything to jeopardize potential relationship with Sally because of the other relationshi
So we went back played our match and as has always been the case with Sally and I or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I we won this matc
After it was over everyone wanted to go out and eat but couldn't because Jocelyn was at hom
And said I can't really thought this was just tennis match I've got to go home my daughter's there So went home didn't hear anything for whil
She explained story about group of people from work and think maybe they'd even rented van um and were making the rounds can't remember all the details of it but she said and thought maybe you'd want to go and she added this cleverly unless you're seeing someone else So was honest with her told her was and that it was in the process of winding down um but really appreciated the invitatio
Several weeks later after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down um invited Sally to go to a um think 25th anniversary party with some some people that worked wit
Um we ended up getting together that Friday night before to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her baptism by fir
Um and she played tennis at our club on Saturday and then we got together and went to the anniversary party and ended up out with some friends of ours after that was over and think basically spent the entire weekend together and just became closer and closer and closer to he
know that fell in love with her that weekend um and ever since then she has been an absolutely fantastic part of my life very integral to the person that uh have becom
And it's just been an amazing period of time to me that was so fortunate to find so much of a to use very corny term soul mate at that particular point in time in my life when I'd really kind of thrown towel in on tha
Um but that's that's little story about how I uh met my wife uh how important she is to me how things just kind of clicked all because she left pair of shoes under her desk and sent us off on the relationship where we ar
Nana was one of the sweetest most incredibly sweet and giving people in the whole worl
She was one of 19 children which is just amazing in today's world to think of house that full of childre
Right now want to talk to you about Memaw that's memaw cap the first and it's all one wor
He took us out to Holiday Inn breakfast for pancakes every single Sunday that we were ever around hi
Her dad lived on well I'm sorry the whole family lived on farm her dad worked on far
Memaw said she was only spanked one time in her whole life and that's when her pet pig die
Well her pet pig died because she snuck it in the house took it upstairs and gave it bath and it died of pneumoni
The only other time that Memaw said that she got into trouble was when it was her job to bring the cows in at nigh
You know she just didn't feel like going up on that hill to bring those cows dow
But she had to so the obedient little person that she was she did it anywa
Well the cows wouldn't cooperate they just would not hurry down that hill back into the bar
She got mad at them so she tied their tails together so they would stay together and come down the hil
Well with their tails tied together coming down the hill along came tree and they straddled the tree one went to the right one went to the lef
Course the tails were tied together they got hung up the knot wouldn't come undone but one of the tails di
don't know if it's true or not but that was one of the stories she told u
The other story that she told us one time when we asked her about her upbringing brought us all to tears because like told you her father worked on farm they didn't have lot of money and yet they had 17 childre
So her father had to walk her down the street she can remember holding his hand and walking down this dirt road with little suitcase and in it was everything that she owne
So from then on in Memaw was being raised by this couple and was happy and had good time there and good life but about year later this couple was killed in car wrec
Memaw was born in 1898 so guess this foster family was tooling around in Model or something but they were killed in car wrec
Now this farm was in WV and don't know how they found this next family but there was family in Baltimore MD that wanted to adopt he
And it was wonderful wonderful man who met her at the train station took her to his hom
She said she had never seen anything this big in her house I'm sorry in her life as his hous
She walked in the front door and there was this great big tile floor the foyer had huge ceiling and spiral stairsc staircas
So she climbed the spiral staircase with him to her bedroom and just couldn't believe i
They had dolls all over the room for her and great big bed that was all hers and she really did have wonderful lif
This gentleman put her through nursing school Memaw became nurse was working in the hospital and was taking care of this one patient in particular woman who had just given birth to twins and had complication
So in the weeks and months that she was ministering to this lady young girl actually she was also getting to meet the family and it was and was becoming involved with the
The lady's brother was my grandfather who she later married and they raised these two children like their own in addition to the other five children that they ha
Memaw had to quit driving once she had children of her own because they cried every time she took drove drove the ca
She died when she was 96 as did Nana and both of my grandfathers died of heart problems when they were each 72 that's kind of amazin
Now can tell you about the story can tell you the story about how met your da
Well Sandra and were getting ready for tournament and we were practicing with Glenn Pennington lady and Julie Calman thin
Well there was this one guy out there who was really cute that had twinkly blue eyes and he was playing on the court next to u
And was in one of my little phases where really didn't want to have anything to do with men because I'd just had really horrible experience and it just didn't have room for it in my life right then but did think he was cute and asked her who he wa
The first time we played was Thursday then we played again the next Monday and low and behold there he was again although he wasn't on the court right next to me but noticed him and noticed he kept looking over at our court but wasn't going to make eye contact because that was flirtatious and was way too shy to be flirtatiou
So we finished playing and watched him walk behind our court and onto the common area and speak to someon
Well about week later get phone call at work from Glenn Pennington who asked me if would like to play tennis that Friday night mixed doubles with she and her husband against me and this guy named Hugh Lowrance and said Who is Hugh Lowrance She sai
Don't you remember That's the guy at the tennis club that you asked me about said Well have you called him And she said No haven't called him yet But think she told him that she hadn't called me yet either so don't really know who she called firs
Anyway said Sure would love to and he said Yep that'd be great So show up at the tennis court Friday night before six o'clock so that won't be lat
Well Friday was casual day at the law firm where worked so had on my nice little linen shorts and my nice little shoes and cute little to
Well the parking lot where worked was two and half blocks away so we would oftentimes wear our tennis shoes in because that's long hike in heels or whatever and had walked in in tennis shoes my tennis shoes that was going to play in that night and promptly left them under my desk downtow
So here stand at the tennis court with this man looking ohsocute dressed all in white with little white vest who I've never met and we're talking like two little magpies and said We have problem He said Yeah see the door to the club is locked said Well we have bigger problem than that He said What's that said I don't have any shoes He said What do you mean you don't have any shoes said Well left them under my desk at work He said That's no proble
Where do you work said Downtown He said We have problem See he hates to go downtow
So he put me in his car and we went to the nearest Omega Sports and bought me some shoe
And the girl that waited on me was able to tell her This is blind dat
And she said Oh my gosh Well he's cute so she made sure had hangers in the dressing room and tried on pair of shoes and they fit put on my tennis clothes and we were back at the court in 15 minute
But we had neat opportunity to talk in the car and we talked and laughed cause we were both kind nervous and kind of silly and we go out to play tennis and we're still being silly and talking and laughing and playing against our good friends Glenn and Fred who we never should've lost game to as we proceeded to lose the first set because your dad couldn't keep the ball on the court basicall
Anyway we decided we weren't going to lose the match so we settled down and we played and won and had good time and thought Well coo
It is Friday night it's about eight thirty or nine But nope your dad goes beelines it right for his car gets in the car and leaves and doesn't even ask for my numbe
Well it wasn't that unusual that guy didn't ask for my number but knew we'd had really good tim
But my little antennas perked up and said Girlfriend girlfriend you can put that in quotes because that's what was thinkin
So picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was going on nope it was called Jazz Fest and that the company worked for had shuttle bus which it did and people signed up for it and you got to go to Jazz Fest and it was lot fun and and said I don't know your statu
don't know if you're dating anybody at the time but if you're not and you'd like to go would love for you to be my guest And he said Well you know would really love to go really mean that but am dating somebody right now and can't said Well that's all right but had great time playing tennis and maybe I'll see you over at the club sometime And he said Cool And hung up the phone thinking Darn wish could meet somebody just like him that didn't have girlfriend But about six weeks later get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was guess who And he said there was party an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did want to go and he was sorry that he didn't get to go to Jazz Fest with me but he had been dating somebody and it was somebody that he used to be engaged to and then wasn't engaged to and they had reconciled but he knew it wasn't going work out but yet they were still dating when played tennis with him but they're not dating anymor
And said Well cool So we went to the party and we had great time and we've pretty much been together ever sinc
OK um just to give you little bit background on my heritage my mother is French and Italian and my father is American and German but am born native of Charlotte NC if you can't tell by the accen
Uh the story that comes to mind the most for me um guess in my life is the story of my grandmother who's now presently 85 years old and actually had flew down here the Friday after the tragedy so it was um think it was the fourteenth of September she flew by herself from France to here to visit us and is still here until December 24t
Um her story actually is what impacted me the most in my life um when think of the things she went through growing up and um how my mother was conceived and everything on that nature which it gets little personal but it's you don't think of your grandmother telling you that but she di
Um my grandmother and my grandfather was in the error of the war and so they were constantly movin
Um he did escape and get out and so him and my grandmother were like he would travel get missing and come back you know but he would always be back with my grandmother and everythin
And there was one particular incident where they were um there were bombs going off because again this was like in the war with the Germans and so fort
Um and they thought they literally thought they were going to die because they were on train and the train part of the train that they were on wasn't hooked to the caboos
So when the train pulled off to get from away from all of the stuff that was going on they were left behin
So they thought they were going die so they decided guess what better way to die than um to make love on the train and that's how my mother actually was conceived was on train and my grandmother had told me about that you know the different things they went through with tha
It was me and my sister and she taught us French before she thought us Englis
Um and remember as child mixing the two languages like might say sentence in French and throw in two words in English um because we learn French in the household and then English in schoo
And all my life she constantly brought us back and forth from um France to um America um to visit my family ther
So still am fluent in French and am very thankful for that um because recently when my grandmother came to visit she has never had heart trouble and um never had anything go wrong with her heart or anything and one day while she was here which was here recently her heart rate dropped real low so we had to um rush her to the emergency room and this was something very scary for her because she doesn't speak any Englis
She speaks like one or two words of English um not to mention she doesn't like to going to the doctor so it was like we had to hit her over the head to bring her ther
But um we finally got her to the hospital and they um ended up doing surgery on her that the next day and placing a putting pace maker um so for her you know to be here you know and get treatment under under those circumstances was kind of scary but she's doing bette
Um and when they say it rains it pours because my mom um recently moved back in with me but don't know how long that will be but um she did and she had been up one night from she had gotten up one morning at like five o'clock in the mornin
By the time had got home from work and so forth it was like 11 o'clock at night and she was extremely tired but my mom is one of these people who constantly has to go and do something she can't sit still it drives her craz
So she thinks she's going to make you know she moved all her stuff back in my house and she thinks she's going to clean it up all in one day so my house is like tornado hit it by this time but you know I'm fin
haven't said anything about it because you know know it's going take few days but she wants to do it all in one day so she's still up at like 1130 at night going back and forth between the attic which you know in the in the attic is in the top of my hous
You have to climb ladder pulldown ladder to get to it and was telling her you know she'd needed to be careful she needed to go to bed because she was tired and furthermore there is like hairline crack in my ceiling in my bedroom um where apparently she had stepped wrong or stepped on the wrong place or something before and it created hairline crack and was telling and stressed to her you know Be careful you know don't step in this area There's hairline crack in my ceilin
So I'm sleeping midnight you know it's past midnight and all of sudden hear this big loud noise and look up and she's hanging through my ceilin
And here's her feet dangling and of course it startles me but I'm very quick reactor so jump out of bed and was pushing her feet up so she wouldn't fall all the way through my ceiling um but mind you this is after told her to specifically not to walk in this area but tell you if you know anything about my mom it's like can talk to the wall better than can talk to her and tell her somethin
But so then if that wasn't bad enough um we were in the hospital and my instincts told me not to let her drive my car but I'm thinking you know if my friends can drive my car from time to time then why can't let my mom drive my car from time to time Dumb question because know my mom and know how she drives and she's doesn't she's not careful but I'm thinking the hospital is 10 minutes from my hous
OK so I'm thinking 10 minutes from my house what can happen Well she's gone and no sooner than she comes back what do she tell me Oh hit something She hit somethin
So not only has she torn hole in my ceiling which still isn't fixed by the way but now my car is all dented u
So I'm just like Lord by the grace of God just let me get through this But um you know she felt real bad about it but this was after specifically told he
I'm like Mommy you know you're real emotional right know I'm saying you know you know upset and be extremely careful what you're doing you know when you drive my car home and she said OK OK And then she comes back and she was like Don't ever let me drive your car again and was like You do not have to worry Hi my name is Alexis Manse
My family is actually from Niles OH and I'm half Lebanese from my father's side and half German on my mother's sid
Um when was young my the story that stands out most in my mind is this story that my dad would tell me that he learned from think it was one of his uncles Uncle Joe or Uncle Johnn
And this is obviously just some made up name my uh great uncle came up with but and my my dad loved these stories as child himself and related them to me when was ki
And Sorry can just ask you how old you were when you heard these stories A
Well guess my dad started telling me these stories when was about three four up until whenever still mean sometimes he'll be joking around at the dinner table and still tell me these storie
But um and the thing was Jehilehi was this hero this brave guy and he had this motorcycl
And he he would always be saving woman from some bear or something or some some some wild creatur
And he would you know at the climax of the story my dad would you know the stories were always varied and they were improvised never the same plot but he would you know get on his motorcycle and speed away into the mountains and fight this bear and save the damsel in distress and they were just pretty exciting stories especially when you are kid you know And then um my mom remember he
She would read me lot of books actually and and she would sing me lot of song
She wouldn't actually make up stories out of the blue but um and the songs that she would sing um can't remember the name of this one but always remember it was abou
sort of remember the words but she told me them when was very little like don't know like four or five maybe even younger and it was always about how um her and my dad loved me so much and there was always don't kno
Uh sorry I'm being vague but and um she would read me um lot of Grimm's fairy tales often and the one remember most is um the one about the oh what was it the one with the hang on secon
It was the one about the girl the dancing shoes or something like this these princesses had uh cast spell cast on them and they had to dance all night with these shoes and until the shoes wore out and their feet were all sor
And then finally I forget how the story went but always remember her reading me this one story and just loved i
And she oh well this this guess both my parents imparted to me was this this album they that we used to hav
It was um actually the story of Hansel and Gretel and they think would like listen to it everyday because just loved it and they would put it on the record player and ah would sit in little rocking chair that we had in our living room and listen to it and was kind of scared at the part where the witch was going to put them in the oven but and my dad would come in and he'd sit with me and comfort m
But loved it so much even though it was scary to me don't know why but um and also actually my grandma which call Situ and that's grandma in Arabi
When was kid would ask her like you know where where she grew up and what it was like in her neighborhood and she would tell me that oh when she was little that all of her cousins and all of her she had big family her sisters and brothers and stuf
And back then Youngstown supposedly she tells me was much nicer place than it is these day
But um she she would tell me about how the kind of trouble they would get into and and how strict her parents wer
And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad got very angry with her and made her go back to the store and and guess the guy had given her too much money back and she hadn't told him that he had made mistake and so she got in trouble way way too much trouble you know unnecessary trouble and she had to walk all the way back to the store and don't know she just made it out that to seem like in lot of ways back then times were seemed so much better and yet so much harsher in lot of way
And supposedly you know it snowed more back then and ah but you know family was closer knit guess so you know pros and cons in every every case but and my my grandpa called Jidu in Arabi
He told me stories about when he was in the war he flew fighter jet and he well when was young he never really got much into the details being as was little kid but he would tell me um about the buddies he met um during the war and some of the turmoil and stress it caused him and um my family on my dad's side as guess you can tell now is obviously lot closer than on my mom's side ah because my grandparents on my dad's side well his parents had more kids than my mom's parents did and and also my mom's ah parents died when was too young really to remember anything they would have sai
Um so so also um my dad's sister and brothers they spent lot of time with me when was little and they they made up little tales about my my dad has has very imaginative and inventive kind of family and they would always be making up these characters and telling me stories about the
Like Fred Fredimecusson and um Connie Connie Bujane and um um oh let's see Ralph Rasselbossum and And how old were you when they told you these stories Well was the age at which they told me stories just it varie
mean it was really pretty much all through my childhood you know up until reached certain age to where didn't find it so interesting anymore but um guess it would be somewhere under 10 or 12 that they would tell me these stories and um it usually would be at night and we'd be back in this little bedroom always would sleep i
And when I'd stay the night at my grandparents house it'd be holiday and all the aunts and uncles of mine would be at the house and they were always very loving and and you know actually um some of the stories remember very much so were the ones that my Uncle Dave would tell m
We'd we'd build bonfire outside because my grandparents they lived out in the country and we'd build bonfire and he would always tell these scariest ghost stories and he would make everyone of them up and they were so incredibly intricat
We would sit around the fireplace my cousin Matt and my cousin Jamie and Jeremy and he would tell me these stories about you know this boyfriend and girlfrien
remember this one where one day they were um they were driving down the road and actually think this one might be generic tale but uh um they went to gas station or something and the guy gets out of the car to pump gas and the girl's been sitting in there but it's been whil
So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesn't see him and she's worried you know Because he's spent you know going on minutes and minutes no
And um so she gets out of the car to find him and the gas station attendant runs out of the the um the gas station and he tells her not to get back in her ca
He's like yelling at her Don't get in your car Don't get in your car  And she's she's scared because this guy's all frantic and so she runs around and gets in the driver's side and she decides to drive of
And he said the name of it was Duck Creek Road which was actually road that my grandparents lived o
And the girl the girl um stops underneath this tree to catch her breath she's really nervous and scare
She doesn't know where her boyfriend is and she hears this after little while she's sitting with her head on the steering wheel she she she hears this thumping on the top of the car Sorry can you just give me one second So she gets out to check what this noise is and she's she's looking on the car she sees nothing and so finally she sort of warily looks up and sees her boyfriend hanging from tree limb and his leg is brushing against the top of the car and she's she's so obviously scared at this poin
She screams she runs down the road just to get as far away from the scene as she can and honestly after that don't remember what happens but something happen
And anyways the point is my my uncle told these stories so much better and he he just the way he talked and the way he enunciated certain words and the way and the level and pitch at which he would speak was just he was amazin
So uh thank you thank you for this time for listening to me ramble about my storie
My name is Kevin McCloskey and um I'm 15 years old and um I've lived in Charlotte since was born and um my parents are originally from KY and have relatives up there that that have some pretty crazy stories that um my grandmother used to tell me about her brother which was he was autistic and um he did some funny stuf
Like one time his sister got doll for her birthday or something and she wouldn't let him play with i
He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldn't let him mess with it you kno
And so he threatened he said I'm going to go sit in the fire And she said Go ahead So he goes and sits down inside the fireplace with the fire o
He got third degree burns all up his back went to the hospital you know he's pretty craz
Uh that's why they say he's retarded but really think he's autistic because he's really good with musical instrument
My mom said when she was little she had um she had little puppy and every everyday it would run around the yar
And one day she was mowing the lawn and they used to have little push mower instead of um like an electric mower and um the dog hit it and the dog split in hal
And my mom she was crying and everything and she took forgot what the medicine was called but it was that stingy medicine that really stung when they would put it against you and um she poured that all over the dog and wrapped it up in bandages and um she put it in box and the next day she heard it barkin
So she ran over to the box and um when she saw the box she uh she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different direction
And then because she was trying to rush it you know trying to keep him alive she said he would run on two feet he would run around the whole yard whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump do flip and go on the other two feet and just keep on runnin
And um my grandparents my father my grandfather he used to be very wealthy before the Depression and uh this one time his father played the world champion billiards player at that tim
And they they played about three games and he cleaned him out all three times you kno
So but um my grandmother had 10 siblings and um she used to tell me when they were little there used to be creek over by their house and um she used to run they used to get vines off the tree and just they would swing on them and like every week some kid just being stupid would break their arm or break their leg break fingers or something and go crying hom
And the parents are just they would never show them they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and um don't kno
Um don't have one story in particular that they told me mean they're kind of short but can just tell you bunch of short one
Um when was little my mom used to tell me this story about monkey that lived on pirate shi
His name was Ketchup and um everyday the monkey would always lag behind you know he would always drag when the other monkeys were running real all fas
And the monkey kept getting you know he was tired of being left behind all the time he never got to do any of the fun monkey stuf
So um one day he got roller skates and uh one day they were like Ketchup Ketchup And he went and he put on his roller skates and he beat everybody back to the pirate shi
And then they were like Wait up Ketchup And uh now that think of it that wasn't the greatest story but thought it was coo
Um my grandma always said my mom and dad they would always they said uh my grandparents said that my mom and her brother were just like the greatest children eve
And my mom would tell me as soon as they got done as soon as their parents were out of the room they would just start going at i
They would pull each other's hair and fight and cuss and yell at each other you know fighting and uh my grandma was always um she always thought they were real nic
Um and my other grandpa um he used to tell me about how he used to fly in the B52s and he said uh he had to escape about three time
One time he went and hold on sorry anyways he would he told us he had to parachute out of the plane about three or four times can't remembe
But um he said he used to have friend that could speak German and he jumped out of the plane and he landed in the French with the French Army and um he um Who you talking to he had this friend that could speak German and um his friend you know he fell in with the French and the he was like he said something in German because he thought they were the Germans and he was like Yeah I'm Germa
I'm just s spy for Germany spying on America And the French people tried to attack him because he was um because he was in German
But um my grandpa he jumped out of parachute one time and he told the people that his boots were too big when he got them but they were like Wear them anyways When he jumped out of the plane his boots fell off But see that's pretty serious because when you land he could break his ankles easy But uh lucky for him he fell in like vineyard and fell into tree and it was in the want to say it was in the Mayor or maybe it was in the equivalent of Mayor over in France and uh they hid him for about three or four weeks from the German from the Nazi troops um just to save hi
But he used to tell me often about his brother which who was Green Beret and he um he everyday they would take him five miles out or six miles out and just drop him in different place everyda
Um and he said one time one time he got about seven purple hearts but um remember one time my grandfather would tell me thought it was pretty cool but um he um he um he was fighting you know the German army and uh not the whole German army but you know he's fighting platoon him and few of his Green Beret buddie
Um and um he went and I'm not sure if this was the Korean War or Vietnam War but um mean not Vietnam but World War I
But um whatever happened he was his whole team went down and he was around quite few dead people and he pulled dead person over hi
And the people saw him and so they shot bullet through the dead person and it um it went through his mouth and but it didn't break any of his teeth or break his jaw it just went through his mouth and he didn't make soun
There's lot of stories that he used to tell me but um remember hearing when went to carnival one time story that was pretty goo
And it was something like uh TailyPo or something and whatever would happen is whoever uh don't even remember think it was like who somebody cut the cat's tail off and he ate it and every night he would hear TailyPo TailyPo want my TailyPo And finally one morning he woke up and his belly had been cut open but uh don't think that's how it went because was little when heard i
Oh remember what used to do when was little used to the stories used to tel
The stories used to tell my babysitter was stuff like uh well today in gym the gym teacher made everybody do back flips and was the only one who could do it all the way around the gym when was five years old mean and um and thought she believed me but um just hadn't learned about sarcasm ye
But um also another story that used to tell people but wasn't true was that when was little my dog my little dog ran me over and stepped on my nose and gave me scar on the side of my nose because couldn't think of any way to do it any cool way of making my scar of how it got there and so just made up storie
heard some stories from my dad about sports but um he used to tell me about when he played basebal
Some of the stuff believed it all but mean some of stuff it was like you know you want to make yourself sound better than you really were sometime
It was hit but just it could have been counted as an error or hit and just made up story about tha
Um oh yeah remember this story when was in preschool that really liked It was about this this uh little guy and his name was like Tee or something don't remembe
And he um one day he was walking with his uh walking with scissors and he snipped his finger and cut his finger and it hurt and uh he would never let his um he would never his mom let him get his hair cut because he was scared that it would hurt too ba
remember when was at Camp Clear Creek when was in Cub Scouts there used to be a there there's the lake Bebe Parker it's more like big pond but we called it it was lak
And Bebe Parker was boy that um got sucked into drainage pipe one one day and um he die
And uh every year I'd go there they would take the whole troop out there and I'd be so scared And they'd be out there they'd be like Bebe Parker Are you there And then you would always hear Help me Help me And was really scare
And never knew how they did it And always thought it was really scary and like the next day we would run down and try to talk to him try to talk to Bebe Parker but uh Bebe Parker wouldn't ever talk to us bac
And then when we were think Webelos or whatever they're called the highest you could be in Cub Scouts they would they gave us a uh they let all the Webelos be Bebe Parker and all it was was big storm drain behind the there was like this big opening down the hill that they couldn't see from the hill they couldn't see it from up there and you just yelled into it Help me It's Bebe Parker Help me Save me You know and stuff like tha
And the Scout leaders would go I see snipe and he would jump on it and he would shake the bag like the big trash bag aroun
Everybody would be yelling and screaming Agh It's snipe And then um it was pretty cool used to always try to catch snipes to
But um eh don't know used to like to read the stories about the Berenstain Bears lo
liked the one about where were at or he where they went to the movies and there was they went to the ballet movie They they um went to the forgot what it wa
It was like guess it was equivalent of Power Rangers pretty much and it was like Power Ranger movie but it wasn'
And um the the brother and sister bear they both had nightmares about each other's stuff and it crossed ove
That's all have to say I'm going to um tell you something about my um cousin whose name was Deirdre and ah I I I'll give little bit of background just it needs to it needs to be put into little bit of contex
Ah was very very fond of my my cousin um she was she was very beautiful person both physically and and spirituall
She was very tall she was very elegant um and she also just she had a radiance about her it was really ah irresistibl
And um she was her her mother was my father's sister was highly neurotic dramatic dissatisfied woman who had been married couple of times before she married Deirdre's father and uh when she married Deirdre's father he had he was he was a a very sort ah of reclusive um schola
But he came from a an extremely exclusive family um they were his name was Livingston Welch and it it's very old American family the Livingston's and the Welch'
And when they combined the families they they ah he was sort of their the legacy is in him was that he was Livingston Welch both familie
And he had been in love with my with my father's sister since they were very littl
My my father's family were were in little area called um Plandome which is next to Manhassett which is right next to Sand's Point and Sand's Point is is perhaps where the the richest people in America liv
And um they ah they knew each other and he was in love with her but she wouldn't have anything to do with hi
very rich nerd but nerd And um my father's family were probably nouveau riche in in in their estimatio
They didn't meet in England they met here but both both of their families had immigrated to this to this country and um they my my grandfather was in banking and um they he made obviously very nice incom
But not quite on the level of the Welch's um who subsequently lost all of their money which is always the way it is in lif
And they were they were part of social milieu that my father's family were close to but not quite i
And um ultimately when my when my aunt finally went through her other husbands ah she decided that really she was ready for some social status and perhaps some money and so she acquiesced to to marry my uncle And they had very peculiar marriag
And at some point along the way and don't know the historical details they the Welch's did lose all of their money and they they had had this beautiful mansion on on Sand's Point um and it was right at the very tip of Sand's Point and they had an absolutely beautiful town home in um in Manhattan on 65th Street ah right between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue so it was the sort of the place to be so to spea
And eventually they they were Livingston in his older in his old age was relegated to the to the kitchen in the subbasement of the building because they sold it to to some woman in New Orleans but they'd kept that part of the building and he loved it that was for him that was like that was the greates
Ah by that time he and my aunt were living in in uh you know sort of uh uh an apartment in on East 57th Street that was just one of those sort of those little run through apartment
And it wasn't bad apartment but nonetheless it was you know not certainly my my aunt's idea of why she might have been ma been marrying my uncle It wasn't quite what she had in min
And they had also stuffed all of this really beautiful furniture um from all over the world into this tiny little apartment so it was very cluttere
Ah and ah first she she got pregnant and don't know how they ever managed to consummate the marriage because by the time knew them as couple they were um my aunt dressed all in black and uh she as said she was very neurotic she was also very very dramatic and everything was overstated and they obviously could couldn't stand each other by this time although they were never rude to each other they just lived completely separate live
And she hurt because she had worn really high heels and she'd been model when she was she was she had been really stunningly beautiful in the thirties and um when she had modele
And uh but she had worn these really really high heels because she was incredibly vain and her arches had fallen so she had to wear these big thick black shoes which she hate
So she would be sort of roaming around the the apartment with all of her her drama and her her overstatement and my uncle who barely ever came home if he could help it ah would live in this one tiny room at the very very front of the apartment that overlooked 57th Street and uh he had nailed down the windows because he didn't want to have any fresh air because he he believed that fresh air was really bad for yo
But he basically spent all this time in the in the kitchen in the subbasement of what had once been his family hom
And he had a German mistress um who everybody knew about ah who sort of took ca took care of him and looked after him and adored him but my aunt couldn't be bothered with hi
Anyway out of out of this wonderful marriage he'd produced these two daughters one of whom was Deirdre who as said just was this incredibly beautiful perso
And ah my my family are are Episcopalian hardly practicing but nonetheless that's my my grandmother had been very uh very religious woman and she she was she made sure that that all of the children were were Christened and um and that certainly my sister and were um Confirmed The Welch's were Catholi
And ah for some reason and don't know who made this decision Deirdre both Pamela and Deirdre my two cousins were sent to ah Catholic school in Tarrytown and um they for some reason according to my aunt who was very hysterical about the whole thing they always recruit some of the young women into the convent according to her So as said you know Deirdre was extremely beautiful very elegant and all of these things so she was not perceived as as being candidate for quote as the family put it to escape from the world but to be out there in the world with all of her her charms and graces and and what have yo
And ah anyway she she decide she said that she was that she made this decision that she was going to go into the convent and become nu
And of course everybody in the family was absolutely hysterical and put out about this but my and my aunt her her her her response to the whole thing was that she needed to see psychiatrist meaning my aunt needed to see psychiatrist to get her over the the pain and the loss of her daughter having made this decisio
So uh but anyway Deirdre was really she she she was a she really believed that that's what she wanted and that was what she should d
And uh as go along I'll I'll talk little bit more about you know my my family's interpretation of this whole thing because that's part of what when I when think of Deirdre and think of the loss of Deirdre some of what try to come to terms with is why why my family interpreted her choice the way they di
But um because the the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn't be part of the world they never they never said Oh she she did this because this is what she believes You know it was simply that Oh she doesn't know what she's doing and she's misguided and she's scared that was the general consensu
And um she was she became she was teaching nun she taught in school um Marymount was the name of the uh of the convent and and the school and they had a school in Tarrytown but they also had school in Manhatta
She ultimately ended up teaching art because she was very very gifted artist um at Marymoun
And when would go over first she was at Tarrytown initially and would go over and would visit her from time to time and it was always just joy to you know to see he
And at that time this was this was before Vatican II and she was fully garbed and it was and it was strange because had been very close to her was very little when but she was very very kind to me and she was always very interested in me and would take me places and include me and so it was strange for me to you know suddenly see her in in in um all in black ah with profuse robes and she had a the um head dress was very it was it was shaped like this it was so you um really could not see very much of her face so that was that was very strange thing for me but she always seemed happ
And um and then there was part of it too where felt like she looked beautiful in wearing what she was wearin
mean they were they were in some way just the garb is very medieval and it's it's it is certainly more interesting than some of what we wear you know in in that sens
But so there as child there was that kind of uh sense of it was strange but it was also interesting you kno
And at that time Spain and I and am not very good on dates and and um historical happenings but at that time Franco was was in um was in control in Spain and they were there was there was the Church was not um was definitely repressed and there was lot of political things happenin
But that's where she was and so there the family was obviously concerned because she was in a in country that was under lot of strife and conflict and and she was an in part of an institution that was definitely not only not supported but was actually persecute
And um she at that time she contracted cancer but nobody knew about it because they um th th the situation in Spain was was such that there wasn't lot of medical um assistance for for nuns and other uh members of the clerg
By the time she came back to this country um she wa she was diagnosed and she had cancer of the uterus and she was completely mean she just was she was very very sic
Um and uh but of course you know it would be obviously more of tragedy if she was somebody who was planning to get married and have childre
So she was think that she was she was comfortable with it in the sense that she it wasn't part of her destiny so to speak but it was it was still very traumatic thing to experience And then she she was she she was because she was convalescing they she stayed in New York they they didn't send her overseas agai
And um she she was also taking classes at the Art Students' League and was taking classes at the Art Students' League so we would pass in the halls and she would show me what she was doing and um and as say she was very gifted artist and she loved teaching and again she still seemed very you know never got sense with Deirdre of there may have been discontent there may have been sense that maybe she had made wrong choices but um she never expressed tha
At some point this was right about the time of Vatican II because she started to wear different clothes and it was it was very um it was very discreet mean she didn't suddenly just go out to Bloomingdale's and buy whole lot of you know fashionable clothes but when would go in to visit with my um with my aunt and if she was if she was there she was dressed in in um very very uh very elegant but understated you know suits and things like that but she definitely was no longer in the full gar
And uh my aunt at that time had was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sic
So Deirdre took was took leave from the convent she was given um permission to um for temporary leave and don't know logistically how that works but she was she was allowed to go home and and be with her mother to help her um go through she was going to die mean everybody knew that she was going to die but to be with her through that whole period and um she did have some operation
And um at that point Deirdre made the decision and her mother did die and it was it was all very traumatic my father was very sick he's manic depressive so we were going through all of that and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt and this and tha
But anyway Deirdre made the decision that she wasn't going to go back to the conven
And she had already taken final vows so it was big it was huge thing for her to make that decisio
never sat down and had discussions with her about it so don't really know what was going on in her heart and in her in her min
But she made the decision that she was going to to leave and she and she started to she continued to teach she she continued to do the things that she was always doing but she just slowly started to to live what would be considered normal lif
And she started to date and she had several boyfriends and uh she was she had met this one this one person and they were going to a some kind of social gathering in in Rye New Yor
They went out and on the way back ah it was late at night um they were on the on the train platform waiting to take the train back into the into Manhattan and this this man who was drunk and his car went out of control and hit both of them and they were both thrown against the uh the railroad track
And you know there was no train coming but they they hit the rails their and she both of them had severe head injuries And um she went to the hospital and at first they thought his condition was much worse than her condition; they felt fairly um and remember we got the the phone call came it was late at night and my father who was a was psychiatrist but he was neurologist psychiatrist so um anything to do with with the brain and the nervous system was um something that he was an expert on and he went over and ah the prognosis at that time was that sh they thought that she would pull out um but she never di
And she she was in coma for week and she just continued to decline whereas this the man that she was with he he got better and he was really in worse condition when when they brought him in and yet he he regain he regained and within couple of days he'd regained full consciousness and he you know and she just she just um she just never came bac
And she died when we were there my sister and were there and she just suddenly just she just let go and she just die
And think she died because she knew we were there and she made decision for some reason that she didn't want to live in this worl
And um I've often pondered that ev you know that this whole thing about that she that she became nun because she didn't um she was scared to live fully in the worl
That there was something wrong with her that she made that decision that that was that was the impression that it was like the worst thing person could could decide to d
And I you know I can't ask her because she's not here but you know wonder well Why why was that always the interpretation mean why wasn't why didn't we as family try to support her more in the decision that she made and to see that maybe that there was that there was that she wasn't trying to run away from the world but that there was some greater truth that she was somehow privy to that she was actually running towards And um you know I I wrote long poem actually twenty page poem about this and I you know I my question to you know to her would be you know Were you happier when you when you actually left the convent and you came into world that was just you know uh striving after money and social status and all of those things mean was that was that really better choice you know was that really um you know did you did you feel more alive making that choice and actually dying under those conditions But can't ask her can only just go on asking myself sort of rhetorically you know When did you feel more real And then you know the question for my family is Why couldn't you accept her decision Why couldn't you believe in what she was striving for Born in Wadesbor

And came over and he said he said Now you got to put bleach in there in the towels to get them clean he told m

Do people in your family normally name children after family members Oh yeah it's big deal in our family we've got more Catherines and Margarets running around than can coun
Well my second question leading into the whole reason for the interview today is childhood stories and what is the first story that you remember from your childhood think the first story remember is um Rapunzl
Do you remember who told you the story My mother Was that your favorite story think so heard it lot and think maybe um related to the princes
So you and your friends used to playact out some of these stories Oh sure think all kids playact things they hear from their childhoo
So of all these stories what do you think might have been your most favorite from your childhood guess Rapunzl
What part of the story did you like the most think when she'd let her hair down and the prince would climb up the tower to the tower roo
What was it about that that you liked so much don't know just thought it was kind of nea
What was your least favorite part of the story really don't think had least favorite par
Of all the stories you read as child do you think any of those childhood stories had an impact on your life Not that can really say you kno
As you get older you realize that they're fairy stories and not based in any real truth but that they were happy times for you as chil
At what age do did you realize that they were more for the fun or mythology or Oh don't know probably around seven eight nine something like tha
Speaking of your reading habits as you got older as teenager what type of reading material what type of stories did you read You know how were they different Oh don't know that they were so much differen
read the um Nancy Drew books and read the Hardy Boy books and um whatever was Black Beauty things of that natur
You know whatever was popular with young teenagers and um kids my age at that tim
You have to remember this was long time ago Reading into your young adult life what type of reading materials did move into then And why Um there was series of books read as got farther into my teenage years and for the life of me can't remember the name of the character but it was um series of books about young woman that was nurs
And um think those made must have made some lasting impression on me because here am toda
So I so guess in some small fashion you associated with some of the characters I'm sur
What types of stories does he write Um he's Christian author and he writes very dramatic stories uh concerning um such issues as the second coming Satan being among us and they're not they're not so much preachy gospel type books as they are very good um drama you know almost scary type stories but they're very goo
So what was it specifically that drew you to these particular books Well to tell you the truth um it was the fly page on one of the books that rea
It was the little synopsis on the back on the inside cover that drew me to the boo
OK What uh does your family have any collection of books or anything like that Childhood books that maybe they passed down through the generations that maybe that was read to you as child or anything like that Not myself specifically but know that we still have copy of um book your mother had from childhood that we read to you as little bo
Would you say that story had an impact on your life or do you think that was just coincidence No it probably in the long run it probably did because it made me think about the you know the desire to do for other peopl
And um guess that kind of those books kind of set me to thinking as younger perso
Were any of your childhood stories somehow related to that in any fashion No uh huh they were the typical little golden book childhood storie
How many stories do you remember from your childhood You know what types of stories do you remember Um oh books like your typical childhood books like Black Beaut
Oh The Grimm's' Fairy Tales um books of that nature Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Snow White and the Seven Dwarf
Did you ever read any of these stories on your own time Oh sure we had we had like said the little golden books that came in sets and other storybook
Um remember reading them myself as child and certainly as got older um reading was importan
It's still important to me now because have such um reality based profession that when I that when do read it's solely for the purpose uh of escaping realit
I'll read I'll read just about anything can get my hands on that does not have anything to do with the medical fiel
Which can't say is particularly that's not completely the case because have read several of the several of the Patricia Cornwell novels and her main character um is pathologist named Kay Scarpett
Um read yes admit it I've read Louis L'Amour uh but mostly the Sackett novels because that deals lot with um the part of the country that was born and raised i
Um and enjoy reading novels about that but as far as reality based reading material don't the newspapers about as reality oriented as ge
Do you think that particular area of the country had any influence on the types of things that maybe you read as child or as young adult Um probably starting in high school it did because my high school English teacher um is published author and is very popular in that part of the countr
And I've noticed in the past couple of years that they're starting to sell his novels out here to
What types of stories did he write His books course you know they always say you should write write about what you kno
His books are centered in that part the country in New Mexico and specifically in the um Hispanic cultur
Uh and the rest of his books are kind of have kind of mystical quality to them because there's lot of mysticism in the uh Catholic uh religion in the Hispanic culture in New Mexic
Would you say that some of the stories that you read growing up were more geo geographically based in that area By authors mea
Um having lived in that area obviously having strong Hispanic influence were some of the stories integrated in that fashion Oh uh sure they wer
You always heard stories about that part of the country about the conquistadors coming into the southwest and lot of the reading material and and uh what not centered around the history of the are
Um books like Rudolpho Aniya's books um Tony Hillerman's books even though they're basically fiction delve lot into Native American culture and histor
Did you ever hear any stories you know like children's stories not necessarily even books but uh maybe stories that had sort of Hispanic nature to them Or background You know like bedtime story or scary story or anything like that Oh sure they're your usual scary storie
But remember um one story in particular about uh it's pretty similar to the lady the one they have in South Carolin
About the lady at the beach that lost her children and she walks you know the the beaches at nigh
This is similar it's about woman who lost her children they were killed and she walks the banks of what we call out there arollos they're they're runoff ditches for flood water calling for her childre
Everyone went to Vicksburg Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence the most beautiful place on Earth surrounded by um lakes Cyprus trees good people right on the banks of the Mississipp
And so when was born my mom went over there and stayed 10 days in the hospital with her tummy strapped afterwards because that's the way you did it back in the 30's to assure yourself of flat tummy when you got hom
Um good manners were extremely important my father would send us from the table if we laughe
We all had special places at the dinner table and I being the oldest of four sat at the end opposite my fathe
My mother sat to his left and he served the meat and she served the potatoes or rice and the vegetables and the food was passed around to everybod
But if would spill glass of milk which often did then was sent from the table but would often be tickle
My father was extremely um uh firm but fair totally unemotional and maybe you might be surprised to hear that because am extremely emotiona
And my mother on the other hand was a Darling this darling that love you Constantl
Constantly we were told how much we were loved and maybe that made great um that was great influence to me but on the other hand my dad um kept level of of intensity level of of uh of wanting to do the right thing always um especially to please everybod
It was congenital heart condition and I've often thought that he would still be in my presence today had we had the medical advances then as we do no
When married my husband soon after well five months after he died cried every night and didn't realize how much his presence was in my life until he was actually gon
Always wanted her way about everything and she was courted by men of all ages after my dad die
don't think my younger sisters mind so much of the time they were young they were still in high school uh but my stepfather was very nice man but he was 10 years older than my mo
He was party man and he had sort of florid face and I it made me little suspiciou
Um my brother and were two years apart and loved him but not until we were 13 think 13 and 11 we were typically quarreling siblings We went to Florida on family vacation one summe
The only vacation by the way that my daddy ended up taking us because all the way from Louisiana to Miami Florida was almost too much for six people in car to be together for 10day perio
But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience he thought it was going to be so much fu
My two younger sisters did not they were three and seven at the time so they were not made to do thi
And so we got on and as we climbed the first little hill it just looked wonderful; we could look out over the over the beach and wave to Mom and Dad and Gay and Annette my sister
And then we got to the top and my brother and were at either end of the seat we still were not too fond of being of sitting together so we got up and then suddenly in our lives began to flash in front of us we were going so fas
And looked at Fred and he looked at me and the only thing could say Dear God if you will let me off of this thing then will never ever again fuss with my brother And so with ashen faces we finally got back and have never yet by the way been on another roller coaste
was extremely close to my sisters because was 10 years older than the baby and virtually called her my ow
Every it seemed like every day but every other day and she would have her lady friends and would have to go in and tend to the babies and make sure that they were dry or had their pacifier or their bottl
And then my sister Gay was seven years younger and felt the same way about he
Everybody has to know all of it whether it's good or bad and sometimes it is bad or naught
My father was graduate of LSU and majored in Physics and he opened radio shop in the back of the stor
And used to work there and I the most fond memory was that had my own special number on the cash register which was great big piece of equipment in the middle of the stor
If somebody wanted to come in and and purchase some type of hardware then would get the nails put them in sack and weigh the
Then would go to the cash register and punch my number in and hand ring the cash registe
All right my name is Sarah Murphy and was born in Charlotte NC and my story is um that my family has had lake house for very very long time and um I've always been told that my greatgrandfather and all of us we have tradition that usually every July 4th we go up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecracker
So I've always been told that my greatgrandfather whom I've never met one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July 4th deal um and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just guess got some messed up firecrackers or set them off too soon or what not but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers of
So that was really and I've always been told that and like said I've never met him or anything but was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me guess to never go near firecracker
Do you remember how old you were when you learned to read When learned to read Uhhu
So imagine you enjoyed reading if you were already and you were four and not in schoo
Do you remember the kind of books you liked looking at and reading when you were little D
The kinds of books that you liked to read yourself were they different from the ones that people would read to you Not really because pretty much chose the book and they would read i
Do you remember anybody in your family that would tell stories without using book grandparent or aunt or uncle No
would say between the ages of to 10 years old it was really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday morning
And one particular movie theater we went to they would show serials every Saturday which were continued stor
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in particular episode and you um wouldn't know what had taken plac
And one of the way they gave prizes was they would take big group photos and everybody and there were stairs going up to balcony real wide stair
And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the pictur
And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled or people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prize
Is that for real That's for real That really happened And one time can remember think it was Steve my brother um he and they would give treats like candy don't even remember what all kinds of prizes the would giv
But for some reason and think this is really true he got ice cream sandwiches Like box of ice cream sandwiche
And of course there's nothing to do with box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at 2hour movie They're going to melt And another um that was in that was in High Point N
And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to � and don't think its even still there don't know if the building is or not � but the Dilworth Theatr
lived in the Dilworth area and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and do remember that it cost cents to get ticket to get i
We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie and sound like I'm 95 years old with those kinds of price
Um but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your your snack that you wante
don't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until was teenager or in my adult lif
But we would uh buy lollipops is what they call them now but we called them suckers and we would get often 2cent sucke
And there was one other sucker that cost nickel and we called that an all day sucker just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day lon
And one other form of refreshment that we got which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday there was bakery next door to the movie theatr
And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do thi
We would go into the bakery and we would ask for a nickel worth of scraps And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movi
And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking mistake
So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with u
And when was young it wasn't strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to movi
mean my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do i
And we could skate to the movie or ride bicycle to the movie and we would do tha
Which is kind of sad that you can't do that anymore and it's not just because things are there're bad people in the world but it's too much traffi
You have to check everything about movie check it out to see what the content is and just wasn't like that when was growing up Also about that same time period in my life guess again between seven and ten years old which seems to be what remember most vividly my best friend uh was Kathy Josey and she was next door neighbor also and we remained friends up until uh she was about 35 and she passed away with cance
And when we were um little girls we used to play Career Girls We did And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswome
And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up we sure did; we got an apartmen
Um Kathy and also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just it seems like remember we both had like our mother's long skirts or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mother
But we had Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother's and didn't have the necklac
So we only had the one necklace and we er we decided don't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever but she said could wear it part of the tim
And we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whateve
And the way we decided who got to wear it first and this always kind of bothered me because know Kathy did this intentionally she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than a
Whenever we only had one of something she would always say Well think the youngest one gets to do it or wear it or whatever first And that just always stuck in my mind that in in our adult life brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn't know anything about that and thought to myself she does and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held trump card on that on
Um also we did lot of pretending and as said we played career girls and the dress up
And my sister and used to pretend also and Jill is about years younger than am maybe two and half and we used to play Robin Hood except we didn't have Maid Marion we had Saretha don't know where in the world that name came fro
But we would switch playing Robin Hood one would play Robin Hood and one would play Sareth
And Saretha was the counter would be the same thing as Maid Marion and why again don't know why we didn't use Maid Mario
And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had big white house with big front porch and uh banisters on it and lot of rocking chairs out on the front porc
And it was just great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or uh it could be castle; just do many things with i
Um and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had huge don't know guess it was an oak tree but it was really big tree but it was climbable tre
And it had real large thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branche
And that was another game that Jill and used to play; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephan
And in the yard we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted um flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a as throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whateve
And had group of girlfriends that ran around with and there were golly there might've been to 10 of us who were good friend
Everybody had their own best friend but then we had one big group that we used to do lot of things togethe
Um and we would had that many girls but we would only go out in couple of cars and remember one of the girls Betty Belle her dad had VW Beetle and we'd fit like girls in that VW Beetl
So we went out one night to the movie but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to and think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now like Pizza Hut and all tha
And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tip
So it wasn't good situation for the waitresses but we had fun and we didn't even think about i
Anyway that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and think it was on at the Manor Theatre and just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a pretty much of spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really great tim
So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found row of seats and we sat file all filed i
And just remember seeing and was sitting in middle section was not on an end so had girls knew on both sides of m
And just remember that movie was had lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and what is it Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is where they're actual horror movie
This was uh real intense um drama and just very scary; kept you on the edge of your sea
And there was scene in the movie remember where every one of us and it wasn't just our group but so many people in the theatre they screamed out at one tim
And really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that that can remember going out with good friend

come to realize when came down mind you you got to think this is the last place that held on to slavery as long as they could possibly hold on to i
Just about you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying So you got to remember that that's still here that's her
Right now they in the process of trying to you know perfect the masch but I'm looking past the masch I'm looking at at the entity or what have you you know classif
I'm looking at it like that you know it gave me all new meaning to uh uh southern hospitalit
That's why when do go to school here I'm going to go to school here for dirt cheap because been living here since they robbed us with Angie and everything so I'm going to go for cheap hurt them and then I'm I'm gon
I'm not going to put no money into the into the community I'm not going to put no money into the state or anythin
Shit by that time it'd be what eight years nine years that's long that's long tim
It's interesting too you'll read about it too and be like Damn that's all right you know what I'm sayin
Um what would like to do is explain to HyeJin an experience had um as as young child uh something that um has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that live in the Sout
Because was born in the North was raised in the North I you know truly am um consider myself northern American um and quite by surprise um we came to live in Charlotte two and half years ago um mainly for work reason
So we came south because this is where the jobs are and fortunately we were able to get work and relocated her
So this is two and half years later and my husband and are employed in the public schools in Charlott
And um we find ourselves in very diverse school which is all good uh we find ourselves um working with many many more uh black or AfroAmerican people than we were ever exposed in the Nort
And that has um made me remember um that when was in um the second grade was seven years ol
And we had never lived in the South before except for one other brief brief time should say we had lived in Camden SC um where act actually one of my brothers was bor
But when was seven we moved to Pensacola FL and um we there were four children and we were enrolled in Catholic school because my parents were Catholics and um they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the Sout
So went to was in the second grade and went to Sacred Heart School in Pensacola F
And two of my very good girl friends when was in second grade their names were Patricia Callahan and Linda Emanue
But um in time we became very close friends and then to our childhood friendships our parents became good friend
So most of our social life was spent visiting back and forth in each other's homes and our parents would have dinner together and they would get together and have parties and they really had wonderful tim
And um as time wore on and our families and our parents became better acquainted can imagine that my parents really being the only northern born and bred people began to see the differences in their attitudes uh in their racial attitudes as opposed to the attitudes of their friends and by that mean um my parents had been raised in the North and there were never um very many black people aroun
guess can say they were Christian they were Catholic um don't believe um they really had any predisposition or any prejudice toward black peopl
And think that when they moved to the South and they saw the prejudice of their good friend
think it really uh really bothered them to the point that they wanted to make sure that their own children did not grow up with those prejudice
Now it was very common when was seven years old and was the oldest of the four children um my mother hired black woman to help her once wee
And she would come to our house once week and she would help my mother clea
She would do all kinds of household um activities because my mother had four children very close in age and I'm sure she was big hel
So um my mother learned of Ira Lee from her very close friend my girl friend's mothe
And Ira Lee come to our house once week and then she would help my mother and then at dinner time can remember we all sit at our dinner table uh four McDonough children and my two parents and Ira Lee always sat at the table with u
But I'll never forget when we went to have lunch at my girl friend Patricia's house where Ira Lee also worke
And it was my mother and me and my friend Patricia and her mother and my friend Patricia's two sisters and we all sat down at the dinner table together to have the lunch that Ira Lee fixed for u
It was not considered appropriate guess it would be the word or it was not considered acceptable in that household to have black woman sitting with sitting at the same�� � � bjbj�=�= 6 M& �� �� �� � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �$ j� � � � � � � � � � � HJ HyeJin Jung Interviewer Chris O'Connor Interviewee START OF TAPE 1 SIDE H
Um what would like to do is explain to HyeJin an experience had um as as young child uh something that um has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that live in the Sout
Because was born in the North was raised in the North I you know truly am um consider myself northern American um and quite by surprise um we came to live in Charlotte two and half years ago um mainly for work reason
So we came south because this is where the jobs are and fortunately we were able to get work and relocated her
So this is two and half years later and my husband and are employed in the public schools in Charlott
Callahan would be shocked So just just remember that very well and never ever let this be known that it happened although it didn't bother me because was very comfortable with Ira Le
just got the very strong message that was not something that should be repeated to this particular lady and the particular lady was very fine person very good person very good mother very good Catholic but she had been raised in the Sout
So that's my um recollection of um Ira Lee of um growing up um in the South in the 50's probabl
think we think we've come hopefully we've come long way from from that um mode of thinkin
Do you think maybe Well think there has been mean if you figured that was in the 50'
mean since Martin Luther King and all of that um still think still still know though that there is still prejudic
Uh both ways white people to black towards black people and black people towards white people and with all the races it's not just limited to blacks and white
That was just my own personal experience but sometimes now not that dwell on this when think of my present working situation were work in school really there are the black children are there are more blacks than whites are it's pretty even but little more black childre
notice um black teachers black people uh notice that at lunchtime when we sit down to have lunch they immediately stop and say silent prayer immediately that's just routine of the
And it's really see it more with the black people than do with the white peopl
learned this story you know probably was about was about 12 years old 12 or 11 somewhere around there you know elementary school about the time when Mom let you walk home from school or you know what I'm saying you have little bit of freedom on your own you kno
So the story uh was told to me by some of the older guys in the neighborhood about somebody that it happened to when he was our ag
It was during the summer probably let's see yeah it was 1986 cause played football that year the summer of 198
And the reason why got confused with the man in the black hat was because the man in the black hat was BH
The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what I'm saying it all started from the time where you know what I'm sayin
I guess you know what I'm saying somebody wore black hat just looked creepy that you'd never seen befor
So we were just like There goes the man with black hat Then come to find out that during that same summer this guy that played on our football team had supposedly was walking through the park Briarwood Park on um Plaz
He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dud
And you know what I'm saying it was real gross because they went into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping hi
He was supposedly this old man in black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kid
And so we started right then calling so we started right then calling him The Butt Hole Bandi
So you know what I'm saying from then on you know for one the dude that uh supposedly gotten raped had disappeared you know what I'm saying mean he didn't disappear he had just like left town and so we really didn't know the trut
You know being kids most likely we would have asked him you know what I'm saying but during that summer he had disappeare
He and his family had left or something like that so we just stayed up in the air whether it had happened or no
So all the older guys and everybody was just like Man watch out for the guy with the black ha
Watch out the for the BHB the Butt Hole Bandit So any time we saw people walking down the street that look didn't look familiar cause we had pretty close knit community so we had people walking around the neighborhood or whatever you know what I'm saying that looked funny everybody would be scare
And we were some bad kids too I'm talking about we was bad I'm talking about throwing rocks at buses and doing lot of stupid stuff but when it came to the BHB for real We watched out you kno
And we always played in the park used to run around the park or whatever but when it got dark nobody was out as far as by themselves and if you was out you better be in shape cause you're runnin
can remember running from it had to be at least mile cause ran through the woods from Orr Road to my hous
Orr Road right over there like going to UNCC to Hampshire Hill through the back wa
And you know what I'm saying so then on you know what I'm saying just like said you had people looking for the people with the black hat and then anybody that came in our neighborhood we would just razz the
And remember one time we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight you know what I'm saying we thought we were the stuff cause nobody could catch us on our bike
This dude was walking through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit but he probably just saying it you know what I'm saying to scare us even mor
So you know what I'm saying he he really scared us and from then on you know what I'm saying as we got older we still like right right when you know what I'm sayin
was was asked to tell the story you know what I'm saying asked my boy and he had so many stories about the Butt Hole Bandi
He used to talk about how he's almost still scared of the Butt Hole Bandit cause nobody really knows you know what I'm saying what happened to the little kid who supposedly got rape
Well you know ain't nobody still seen him to this day but most likely probably if that did happen to him he's probably so embarrassed to come back around or whatever they probably moved awa
But mean you know the Butt Hole Bandit story was was one of the biggest ones and it was the man in the black ha
And you know kids we was playing sports always out at night being bad so you know what I'm saying so anytime the Butt Hole Bandit came up everybody got tens
You used to purposely spend the night over to people's house cause you scared to walk hom
And say if it was like say eight houses down street either you were going to run or we were going to have our mom pick us u
So you know what I'm saying it was just really shook whole bunch of us kid
It's like one of them little urban legends of of man who went somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us; you know what I'm sayin
The story that am going to tell is about my great great great granddaddy who was bootlegger from Yanceyville N
Um think this story well the story been told through my family because of uh what he had and what they tried to take from hi
And he was bootlegger and the sheriff and all the deputies guess evidently he had the best moonshine in all of Yanceyville so so the uh the sheriff you know was friends with them you know and use to get his liquor from him and the deputies and stuf
Had farm chickens cows bulls all that good stuff lake on the property and um couple of the deputies was in the KKK couple of the deputies was in the KKK and um and what uh else did they use to say They said mean he was the man you know they said back then you ain't see too many black guys with brand new trucks and stuff like that but he had the new trucks and ah he also ran numbers to
They said that he ran numbers and um the deputies use to tell him you know to watch out you know some of the cooler ones that won't in the Kla
But the sheriff you know always said you know he told him when it was really time for him to get out he needed to get ou
He was going on and on and on and he was mixed at that you know he was half white and black but they ain't really didn't too much bother him about that because of the fact his daddy was black and his momma was white you kno
They had problem with that but um um he had lot of money from what understan
lot of them white people start getting jealous and start trying you know take the property and stuff doing little stuff going out killing his chicken
They use to come on he use to charge people to come on his property and hunt deer and they use to sneak on and stuff and he catch them out there but he couldn't shoot them because he know he'd get lynched if he did tha
And then one day um somebody got jealous came down and burnt down the trailer he had trailer on the property then came and burned down the trailer and burnt up the chicken coop but eventually he got all that bac
Kept on bootlegging and they still getting jealous and remember going to after getting all of that back you know bac
It's still there now but remember and still do when we when go to the family reunion
don't go in there though but always go out to the uh where they got the cows and the bulls at and check them out and go and get up on desk stand and see where they a
And um he even still got some of those old kettles back there they broke and all mess up and stuff and his kettles were hidden inside the chicken coo
When it really got thick when um it got to one point where him and sheriff fell out and the sheriff you know he wasn't really guess evidently let them tell it he was the cool gu
And the little Klan people um found out you know what the sheriff's men or whatever what was going o
And they were already jealous black man making money or half back man making money or whatever you want to call it and they came and burnt the house down burnt the chicken coop down and they killed cow or couple of cows ain't too sure about that but think they killed cow or couple of cow
And um they tried to take his land from him and they took it from him for minute and he went to jail for little bit and he got out and still you know couldn't get his land but he bought bought and bought and he got his land bac
And um now you know every family reunion is held there and and um the land is divided up you kno
Every little person in the family done bought acre of land or how many acres they wanted to bu
Chicken coop back but ain't no chickens in it though don't know what they did to the chicken
They're all over the property and they still sell the um you know they rent the land out during guess deer season to you know peopl
They got to pay though you know to come on the property because there're deer stand all throughou
And think they should make them pay to fish because big ass lake big old lake out there and they you know want to go fishing there but I'm driving from out of town and it ain't like I'm carrying some fishing rods or nothin
They got they got um think they should make people pay to fish too and the people it's his it's his niece that's my Aunt Claudi
They got four wheeler trails and stuff out there now and all kinds of stuff four wheelers and stuf
And we got what else mean it's nice story because would have like to live back in them days you know the bootleg and moonshine stuff mysel
And um what else We oh you ride pass there now you know like we going to the family reunion you just be riding down because you got to rid
You ride down way out in the country first of all then you make left tur

You think it you think you are at um Aunt well Aunt Claudia well she live you know directly on the property but um my granddaddy Owen property my great great great granddaddy Owen property and the mailbox is at the end of the street and you turn make right and get on this dirt roa
And you driving for about two more miles two more miles and kid you not you driving for about two more miles but that's um that's is the prettiest scenery you will ever see because you you see the lake on the righ
You see deer running in and out you know just crossing street and carrying on but they need to pave that road because ain't nothing but buck of dirt and you get on down ther
I'll quit renting that out but it ain't her house anyway ain't her property but anyway back to the stor
Yeah they finally done took all of his stuff well tried to take all of his stuff but he got it all back and he was popular guy you know and um he start bootlegging again and you know still the same sheriff or whatever but he the sheriff they squash their little beef or what not and the sheriff told him you know was telling him when he really need to get out and finally he got smart and he just did i

Don't most oil places oil change places vacuum your car out Anyways I'm tired of talking about this it's just the worst experience of my life and I'm not very happ
Um Mom and Dad were married on August the ninth 1937 and that was my mama's birthda
If you remember the sign it was down next to the Red Pig right on Corben Avenu
But other than that she's lot of fun and has wonderful personality but my dad and she both came from big familie
Her mother my grandmother on my mom's side was Howell and that was Howell Baptist Church down towards Monroe on 601 down towards Monro
And uh as said he grew up in town but his parents my grandparents originally lived out on the eastern part of Cabarrus County which is uh they lived out Gold Hill Road and Irish Potat
Uh probably sometime around the turn of the century just prior to the turn of the twentieth century they did move into town and they built an old house and lived excuse me where uh HeiligMeyers i
That's where my greatgrandfather William Propst and his wife my greatgrandmother Etta Caroline Etta Ritchie Propst live
My dad had sister had several sisters had three had four sisters but there was one her name was Mary Propst Mary Elizabeth Props
She never married and lived to be she was born in 1901 August tenth 1901 August ninth rathe
She lived to be about 95 years old never married was schoolteacher like to say all her lif
As most teachers are uh which is guess the first thing that learned to admire about he
school near town and um but It's hard to believe that somebody could be  both teacher and principa
We had one of many bond referendums school bond referendums that was really working hard o
It was 22 23 million dollars an incredible amount of money and she asked me to come dow
You know Why are we doing this What do we need the money for How is it going to be spent She genuinely Uhhu
Although she was 92 or 93 at the time she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the othe
And so would try to explain to her how it was very important with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County to keep the uh the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could and we weren't meeting that with the growt
understand and went on further to say you know just just gave several reasons that she she agreed wit
And went little bit too far said uh And besides you know when kids get up to around 30 classroom size of 30 these teachers could never do it without an assistant She said to me she says An assistant with 30 She says My when was coming up you know well I had 40 and 50 students and didn't have an assistant and was principal She didn't say it that way she didn't mean it that wa
forgot now that when he was born probably uh probably sometime around 18 1828 1830 183
He served in the Civil War as captain 57th Regiment out of Cabarrus County and he didn't die uh until the early 20'
Um and when my greatgrandmother died sometime in the early teens my greatgrandfather came back with to live with my grandparents and Mar
But here am knew and became very close to someone my Aunt Mary who in turn took care of my greatgrandfather and knew well was old enough to recollect you know his storie
But got good bit of that on tape and uh just interviews similar to this uh fascinatin
recall her talking about how she cared for him once he did come back from the war and he had smallpox scar that he always had problems with which understand there was lot of tha
But especially through the war years he would write her and talk about you know his arm and she knew exactly what it wa
But uh uh or or she didn't know at the time but later he he described that and she recalled taking care of it even even in the later years of his lif
But she he had my greatgrandfather had written lot of letters during the Civil War home to my greatgrandmothe
And uh fortunately Mary kept them all those years and then when she passed away just few years ago she left them to m
And so it's amazing reading the history of those letters not just not just the history of the war but the letters what they talked abou
They have plantation probably five or 600 acres out at Irish Potato Road at the time and lot of what the letters talked about to my greatgrandmother were ideas of what to d
If you could imagine and and let me say this some of the letters that have that love the most that are dearest to me are some of the letters that that she wrote hi
And in reading her letters to him wherever he might be lot of the letters come from obviously in and around Fredericksburg VA in 1862 186
And uh she would ask What do we do now about the wheat What do we do about the oats What do we do about the cattle What do we do about this What about this timber Uhhu
Do trust this man You know you think about it uh probably prior to the Civil War she she didn't have this informatio
You know they probably she if you think about it she not that he kept anything from her it's just that uh she probably took care of the house if you wil
And all of sudden he's up and gone for four years for three and half year
But uh then he would respond you know Well you can trust this man or you can't trust this person or I would suggest that you do this But always to t He would always you could see the respect building in him for he
Here's I'm trying to answer some of your questions but and this is what think maybe you might want to consider doing Uhhu
I've been asked to recount the story of how first came to be going out with my present girlfriend who more than likely will end up marrying in year and half or s
Well the story goes something like this Late November early December don't remember which 1990 1990 had drea
And as drove to school the next day with my best friend guy I've known longest in the world Jeffrey Mossier we discussed this dream ha
And we discussed it and he said Wow And said Jeffrey I'm probably going to marry this girl And well that was like nine years ag
[Clears throat] So you know we got to know each other little better; we'd gone to school together since the seventh grad
And we started doing that flirting thing you know acting like boyfriend and girlfriend flirting doing this that and the other but nothing officially ever happene
So one day band fruit day very nasty day kinda funny asked her out to movi
It caught her little bit off guard and she said Yes And we went and saw one of the poorest movies I've ever seen in my life Three Men and Little Lad
Anyway we went and saw that movie; both of us hated hated it and think we may have actually hold held hands together in the last half of the movi
Then we went to BaskinRobbins and she got some Chocolate Gold Caramel Ribbon ice cream and got Mint Chocolate Chip and we ate and we made mess and drove her hom
She was wearing this big huge green Cinderella dress that she won't allow me to mention any longer because she hates it no
And then ended up giving her my high school class ring cheesy And on November the first this is good story playing Ultimate Frisbee with my buddies on Halloween Day and dove to knock the Frisbee out of somebody's han
dove in front of them and as dove in front him he grabbed the back of my shirt sent all my weight forward and ended up landing on my thumb and my index finger of my left hand right hand and broke couple of balls in my wris
Had to wear cast for five or six weeks and then another little cast for five or six weeks after tha
Anyway the night afterwards November the first we had gone to football game in Greensboro or Gastonia Ashbroo
And after the game was over we got back to school and we talked out in the parking lot for what seems to be foreve
And asked her if she wanted to wear it since couldn't because it would you know the hand had the cast on i
Anyway she said Yeah sure and we giggled and laughed and then we went our separate ways and went hom
So all senior year we went out about every Friday movies hanging out with friends doing whateve
Then sometime in June or July after we graduated we had really long talk about what we were going to do because we were going to different college
What schools were you going to went to NC State University in Raleigh NC she went to Wake Forest University in WinstonSalem N
And it's only an hour hour and half hour and 45 minutes drive depending on the traffic depending on how fast you fly above the roa
But we had talk about whether or not we wanted to continue dating or whether we wanted to break it off or whether we wanted to continue dating but allow the other to date other people while we were in colleg
And well the consensus was we should probably keep in touch but that we should give each free reign to to date other peopl
And we made it all through six years of college together discussing quite often whether or not we were going to end up marrying each othe
And while she ended up taking job in Atlanta which was little bit further from Charlotte than WinstonSalem was and she wanted me to move down ther
But well we've gone through some little fights here and there about whether or not wanted to be down in Atlanta and whether really wanted to be with her and whether she really wanted to be with me if didn't really want to follow her at all all the way down ther
But anyway she is probably going to move back here and we will probably get married and have kids and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because am Prince Charming and she is the Princes
We've been here about 13 years and we have two children Wes and Megan who uh one just finished college and one other one is uh Megan is junior at Carolina this this fal
Um we have enjoyed guess our move here and the people we've met and all just the differences gues
We kind of had some uh not reservation about moving it was an elective move for us but certainly um living in different part of the country than we were used to was uh something which was change for us and something that we had thought long abou
But coming here rather than um perhaps picking up and focusing on the differences think we tried to look at the uh you know just the um the the special points about the uh life in the South and and the people here and the customs and think it's been something that we've always uh value
Some some folks uh either uh from the South don't value the people from the North and vice versa but think it's been real positive thing our move for us in many way
Um he was at a just uh had real good group of kids or boys that he was friends with and did lots of things wit
And when he came here uh you know having to start all over for him was difficul
And think it took him little while uh longer than our daughter who fit in think with group of people pretty quickl
We've um we're members of Matthew's United Methodist Church and have been there for almost the 13 years that we've been here and have had various um areas of participation and leadership there and have been pretty much part of the communit
Uh we have family in all parts of the country or at least this part of the United this part of the uh Eastern United States in VA and K
And uh my wife's family is scattered uh back in OH and in FL and Denver C
But we find that a fairly intentional way every year of getting together and we enjoy just uh doing some fairly mundane thing
But when we get together we um that is we just enjoy eating food we enjoy putting puzzles together we sometimes go to the beach and just do as little as we can as possible and just enjoy you know doing things togethe
So we have fairly um would say strong family and important to us and are fairly intentional about getting together as often as we ca
Um What are some of the differences you noticed when coming down here from that you mentioned Differences well it's uh think there's you know just different uh phrases and different ways of saying thing
think that uh it will take while for me to get used to mashing button on an elevator or or um I'm just trying to think of instead of taking someone home that you would carry them home or carry them to the stor
We picked up pretty easily the um phrase for you know Hello or greeting is Hey And usually that was something you said up north to get someone's attentio
Like Hey you or Hey Over there But here it's just greeting and we've gone back to visit in OH or elsewhere and we pretty much it's just become part of our language or usage as well and um you know people ask us about i
But we've picked up some things and then certainly there are other things that language wise we um still find uh little different to get used t
Uh think that don't know guess in terms of pace of life don't know that it's lot different from what we were used t
think that maybe in the northeast you would find maybe things to be more hectic or people to be perhaps less friendly but think it pretty much depends on who you are and where you are and the kind of person you are as as to whether or not you you know make friends easily or whether you know you actually put people of
It seems if you're used to if you're if it's in your nature you know to treat people with respect that you don't have that you know problem fitting i
Uh but if you try to emphasize guess differences then think then that's probably another issu
One thing that was kind of interesting too was that we uh you know just some strange things about Charlotte in fact is that when we came here well we're back in OH mean there's fairly uh developed very well developed library syste
And there mean just good libraries and large libraries in neighborhoods and certainly the downtown are
When we came here they were just finishing the new main library in uptown Charlotte but still there were uh libraries in storefronts on Independence Blv
it was the Sharon Library and very small one in Matthews and and the rest were just hither and yo
And now we have one of the guess wellrecognized library systems and probably the better ones in the United State
We have regional libraries that have just seemed to have grown up in both the University area and Rea R
And it's just amazing how much change there's been a dramatic change there has been just in that one institution alon
Um and you look at other kinds of things and think Charlotte and maybe it's typical of the South but think that uh maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in who looking for service
And you and you also have a government um who are are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that Hey listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last you know 100 years whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not we're going to keep things the way they are In fact the town of Matthews think um at least my understanding is is that when Providence Plantation uh reached certain point in population they they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to that they petitioned the town of Matthews to anne
But the town of Matthews at that point said No because they were afraid that all these people from other places would come in and be part of the town government and change thing
And so they decided to you know basically vote the outsiders out and it will keep the town uh smal
We were used to um probably some smaller parks and and and larger parks regional parks and state park
But we would often go to to hike and actually they had cabins and things like that other activities and with them that we di
Um but peoplewise think we've we've found people to be probably pretty much the what you hear about in the Sout
And that is the Southern house hospitality and the people are for the most part warm and friendly and um and and that's been just a really nice nice part about moving her
think that I it just depends on what the accent is but could sit and listen for hours to to certain southern accent
enjoy listening uh to people who have grown up in the area and who speak with that accen
It used to be when you could come here that uh that still the people who were native to Charlotte or to the South were the greatest number of the populatio
And now it seems like at least in the place where work and other people we run into lot of people uh seem to be from other places and fewer people you know are just native to uh to the Carolinas or um to the Sout
Um just trying to think of other things that might be difference Well guess work for the city of Charlotte and I'm probably partial uh to to governments but worked for the City of Dayton before and also with regional agency in Clevelan
And think that um that in terms of at least Charlotte if the if the city government is is is at all representative of of just the politics here both in the private sector and the public sector there's just real interest in in uh in in getting things don
And and also think not necessarily in reinventing the wheel but in looking at everything that you do to see if there's some way that you can't do it bette
And to reengineer processes to uh to try to again be you know guess good stewards of the public's money and to and to act in a in very reasonable and responsible way and to provide basic good basic service
And think that whether we're talking about um you know that or we're talking about cando spirit to do other civic projects public projects partnering with the private sector think that there is just real attitude to again be place of excellence and to find way to get things don
And think Charlotte is is recognized as not only as a it's business community and growth community but also as community that has one of the best um governments uh in the nation for for at least populations cities our siz
Um and so that's been a think good change for us uh since work in that environmen
One thing is it's been difficult trying to now now that my family starting to move down here think that the one drawback was uh just moving probably eight hours away driving time from um from Dayto
But now most of our family is in other places and so that's probably not as much of facto
And our families were friends for many years and so we were acquainted that way but it wasn't until was probably sophomore in college that uh we started datin
And um she went to Miami University in OH and went to Purdue in IN so visiting was uh problematic but we we did find way every couple of weeks to um to get togethe
was in graduate school and then we graduated and we went to moved to Cleveland she finished u
Even though she went to Miami for two years Purdue for two years she still had some classes to make up and so she went to Cleveland State and to Baldwin Wallace in Cleveland and finally graduated with a with degree from Purdu
Um you know had an assistantship with with the university so we were pretty much sufficient on tha
But we learned uh to uh to do with uh very little and to um just enjoy you know getting to mean being together and and knowing each other and finding neat things to d
And so think that we've we've pretty much carried that through uh the rest of our life in many way
think we enjoy you know being together we enjoy um you know talking [clears throat] and doing some of the simple thing
If we have other things that's great and we we seek those out but we're not mean we're not we enjoy spending time together and don't necessarily seek time apar
And we've been doing this now for about 28 years so it's been a good marriage for u
My father lives in Queens NY off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside and my mother lives in the Poconos which is known as Stroudsburg P
I've been down here now would say oh about seven seven years now going on eight year
came down here originally on a to play baseball in the Charlotte area at uh one of the colleges here in Charlott
And uh guess I'm what you would refer to as Damn Yankee because haven't left; I'm stayin
I'm presently going to be going on my way out to Denver CO for job opportunit
His side of the family is Austrian Jew and my mother's side is uh Roman Catholic Italian from uh from Brookly
When did your um father's family come to the United States Well he he believe he is guess it would be you'd refer to third generatio
Um Do you know why his parents' parents came think just like everyone else for an opportunit
And um she's going to calm me down lot think and uh instill lot of instill lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferre
How did you meet her Well was fortunate enough to meet her in college in which we were best friends for about two and half year
Until uh finally don't know the light came on guess for her should say because for myself the light came on pretty much as soon as met he
And my uncle was in town who both my father and my uncle were born and raised in the Bronx not too far from Yankee Stadiu
And uh we were down on FiftyThird Street which is five blocks away from Central Park and um my fianc�e had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary so decided to surprise her with walking down to Central Park off of FiftyEight
was lucky enough for her to say Yes And um so yeah she's been up north couple of times and in the PA area as well the Poconos where you hear the honeymooners always g
And um it's going to be new adventure for us going out to Denver CO with me being pharmaceutical sales representative and my fianc�e being in the medical profession as well being nurs
But would would suspect that we would end up back up maybe in the Charlotte are
Um but it's good we get to start our lives together out there and hopefully uh start maybe in couple years maybe two to three years tops four start working on family of our ow
Now if you have sons would you want them to play baseball too would definitely woul
What was what did you like best about playing Well it was always an escape for m
which was the big thing and um like being competitive know my fianc�e is very competitive as wel
So know if we do have little boy even little girl know there might be good chance of being some good athletes in the famil
I'll definitely want them to pursue baseball but by all means it's probably going to be whatever they want to d
don't want to force them or anything so So where do you see yourself in about 10 years from now In about ten years definitely in the NC are
In 10 years from now start setting some sort of ah foundation for the family we're raising in some sort of steady hom
And no more making big trips out to CO or making big move for the company or something of that natur
I've been there for about two and half years but grew up in small town in Connecticut and basically came down here um just first for the University but then landed job so I've been staying here workin
was looking for city down south and kind of wanted an idea as to something new something upcoming and from what understand Charlotte is quite growing cit
So it seemed like really good place to come to and so far really like i
Um have four sisters and we're all about year and half apart and we're going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral in Florid
So think it was maybe four years ago four four or five years ago and um we left actually just three of my sisters and wen
And um we left Connecticut and we were driving down we were driving in my sister Diane's um Ford Escort which she'd had for about year and half and uh we were driving and everything anticipating good weather and think we were just about right outside of Savannah GA and was driving the car and her car is standard and um the clutch went out on the ca
So was driving and said to my sister Diane Di don't think think something is wrong with the clutch said Because it seems to be on the floor meaning it it wasn't didn't feel like it was connecte
And um she said Pull off the side of the road so pulled off into this um guess it was like rest sto
But there weren't any pay phones lot of truckers few people whatever so we stopped and definitely the clutch was broke
So my sister has CB and so we tried to radio some people that didn't wor
This woman came through with cell phone so we called for help and this honkytonk kind of guy don't know where he was from he was operating basically his machine shop or his repair shop right out of this truc
He didn't have license plate on his truck He didn't have decal saying where he worked or anythin
But so it was about three or four o'clock anyway so we sat on the curb and waited for this gu
He comes first and assesses the situation and said I think that your clutch cable snapped and it's not really big deal we can rig it up so you guys can get to where you got to go you just have to get it fixed So fine so he leave
And we flag down an officer and he comes and he tries and tells us he proceeds to tell us there was black belt wait the murder belt don't know this guy was crazy this cop he said that we were in really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest sto
So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking Oh my God we're going to die right And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about think it was late March early April it had to b
Anyways this guy comes and he fix he must have left about four times don't know where he was going but don't know where his shop was but every time he comes back with some crazy thing and he eventually fixed our car with some uh chicken wire think he rigged it up wit
We have no idea Anyways we got in the car and it got us to Savannah G
And we arrived in Savannah um it was Mardi Gras was it Mar no it was S
The woman the desk attendant the hotel we checked in well first we couldn't find any hotels because it was booked apparently Savannah is like really crazy around S
So um we got there and this woman had long green nails on it was kind of craz
So couldn't go out think was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21 uh 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink and we decided not to go out considering everything that had happened that da
So we woke up the next morning we went down and we drove down to F
think it took us in all about 23 hours maybe 24 because she Cape Coral is on the West Coas
So we got there and my grandma is of course excited to see us and we unpacked our stuff and everything and we proceeded to lay out in the driveway and my younger sister Nancy um being her first time in the sun decided she didn't want to use sunscreen because she really wanted to get good suntan she got good suntan she got sunbur
After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her suntan lotion on the back of her leg and it left nice white print like hand print on the back of her leg and the rest of her got sun burn
So then we basically um we visited with our grandmother and have some step family that lives down there so one night we went out with our cousin Teddy and we uh went out to some clubs with him and everythin
Um and then we went to let's see For want to say it's Fort Myers Beach think the beach is on the West Coast we went down it's about an hour from my grandma's and uh it's really nice beach it's uh was pretty warm that da
think we all got some color but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um luck be it since we were having such good time um Allison Nancy and decide we are going to take walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on the
However Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on fish and it got barb which is one of it's defense mechanisms stuck in her foot so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everythin
So we go to this gas station and they tell us we have to go to the hospital so we go to the hospital in Cape Coral and think we were there for probably ten hour
OK was four years old from what my mom tells me was four years old and was walking on the beach with my grandfather and apparently stepped on sticker bush and had like four stickers in my foot And it just stressed me terribly and was crying and crying and kept on just saying I need doctor need doctor Get me doctor And guess my grandfather convinced me to take them out of my foot and lived to tell this stor
What stories do you tell Gage Like books do you read to him Um we read what do we read We read all kinds of book
What's his favorite Um he doesn't really have favorite; he picks whichever one is going that nigh
He just got book it's called um Eagle Boy and it's about a um Indian tribe on the CA coast who does uh they run out of food in the area where they ar
Anyway so it's about this Indian tribe on the CA coast and wherever they are they run out of food and they decide that they have to mov
Well this one little boy had always um been real nice to the eagles and thought they were really cool and all this and um for whatever reason the tribe decides that they need to leave him behind and they leave him on the beach as they paddle of
Well he was starving and an eagle came by and dropped salmon down for him or some fish and he was able to ea
And it's because he had always been nice to the eagles and talked to the eagles and all that and they saw that he was in troubl
Well he really liked one of the little girls who had gone off with the rest of the tribe and so he told the eagles to drop her some food because he knew they were starving too and the eagle di
And then they realized that it was all because of the him that the eagles were dropping them food and so they came back and got him and it was one big happy tribe agai
Um he likes what other stories do we tell He really likes to make up storie
And the Power Ranger has to overcome some huge enemy and it's usually bloody battle but the Power Ranger always win
He'll make up those from Eden to Greensboro which is 40 minutes long and you have to do i
And so he that he usually does that with his grandmother and they make up story the whole way hom
And he tries to get me to do it but cannot talk to like that 40 minutes so we just usually make it halfway with our storie
Um what other stories do we tell Any good life experience stories No Um we tell Gage about like we'll tell him about like if you do this you know could be hur
Like um When was little knew boy who stuck his head out and got hit by the by the telephone pole while he was in the car and killed hi
Don't stick your head out Um like when he one time we were at my mom's house and she had just made pies and he saw them come out of the oven and he knew they were hot but it had been sitting on the stove for little bi
And he went up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him you know times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will sto
And plus you know Rob can talk away fire so we had to call Daddy and tell him to talk away Rob Gage's fir
See he can't tell you but he does something like this and then he has to know your birth date your birth date your age don't know something else and it it works I'm not kiddin
The next time you burn call Rob and he'll say How old are you and what's your birthday and then you just hang up and it will go awa
Now maybe if never called him it would just stop hurting anyway but don't know So Rob can do tha
Let's see what's another story Um what's something else Anything good you remember just like childhood story like something you did when you were child teenager No teenager stories When you know my dad had that hearse that convertible hearse Well he used to like there was like convertible hearse You knew about tha
You knew the hearse that he anyway we had neighbor who said I bet you can't take hearse and make it into convertible and my dad said I bet can Dad went out bought hearse cut off the top and painted it like bright yellow and it had red velvet seats in i
mean oh my gosh it was in our garage for years Anyway so Dad Dad made this convertible hearse and he used to take all the neighborhood kids and there was like ten of u
Hooker what Hooker hunting So we'd go downtown and go There's one But see and really it was just to go to Dairy Queen cause you had to go downtown to go to Dairy Queen and he was really taking us all for ice cream But we used to call it hooker hunting And so the kids would come over and go Phil can we go hooker hunting We'd do that and um that's my dad Jesus What else would my dad do My dad did all kinds of crazy things to our hous
He would he had the canoe strung up in the tree on pulley system so all he would have to do is pull the car up underneath the tree and he'd let the canoe down on the car unhook it back by the hearse was the canoe in the tre
Hi my name is Sandra Reid and am part of family of seven children um and my mom and dad have passed awa
We did not have very much but my mom always found way to keep us busy or keep us entertained and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories reading poems and singing to u
One of the stories that would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind guess mostly mainly because it was scar
Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were O
Out of all of my sisters and brothers was the laziest one of all as far as working around the hous
learned after got married so was pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cookin
Naturally start crying and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me either my stomach or that had headache or something was wrong with my le
So after she noticed that was going to be just little stubborn and not follow do what she tell told me to do she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the famil
And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the tabl
don't feel good The little girl disappointed her mother so badly but her mother said How in the world am ever going to get her to wash these dishes So she said Little girl little girl if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like asked you something really really bad is going to happen to you So the little girl just said OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good tim
All of sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the ai
And before you know it the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head of
And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying Daddy Daddy Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife Now that knife when went to sleep it really scared m
But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that was O
Now after that my mother continued to tell us many many scary stories and tell us many many many poem
As told you in the past we were very poor family and never got the chance to go to college because of thi
Uh while was in high school teacher of mine noticed that had an extra bone in my foot and she said Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward on your grant to go to college So she said Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we you know can follow through with applying for grant scholarship grant for you So that night went home and asked my mother about it and she said Baby really want you to go to colleg
But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and just don't have the money At that time my dad was in prison at the time so it made it really hard for my mo
sat there and cried but tried to be as understanding as possible because knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for u
Smith so to make it easier on my mom to as far as you know him staying at home and going to school to
I in later years went on to college some but didn't complete the uh whole four year
Um remember once when was working in mill and was spinning yarn and was saying to myself and was praying actually and said God one day want to work in the school syste
If could just work even as teacher assistant would be happy As the years went by my prayer was answered and got the chance to work in the cafeteria as cashier and the principal there came up to me and said Have you considered being teacher assistant said I would love to So they told me about some classes that could take at Central Piedmon
But he told me to go ahead and try it so took the entrance test and they accepted me into at the school and took some courses ther
After while the principal said I would like for you to bring me your um transcript so can see what your grades are like Luckily had all A'
At first didn't want to apply for it but the principal called me during the summer months and said Sandra the time is running out you need to apply And he told me would have to write this pape
Well didn't like writing at the time but took it upon myself to go ahead and write pape
And went to um one of my staff members and asked her if she would proofread it and she thought it was an excellent pape
Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity so felt very proud of mysel
My husband became very ill with cancer and had to make decision as to whether would continue my education or take care of him and felt like needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while was going to schoo
But you would have been able to be a teacher if you had continued Yeah and at the time was also working in the classroo
guess you'd say as sub because the teacher that was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take leave of absenc
So worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put damper on my wanting to be teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that was taking care of very sick husban
After all of this was after I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to schoo
just got to certain age and said No can't do this anymore so never went bac
But love what do and uh anytime get chance to teach in classroom go for it s
So was in those situations where first come first transfer last come first to transfer ou
didn't particularly want to come here and when came here everybody noticed that was really really sad because loved being at Enderly Par
If I'm not mistaken think I've been at Berryhill for think 17 years 17 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and hope never have to leave until retir
Um that really don't know why they closed that school down because it was really nice school and everything but they eventually tore it down because was there think the first year went there was the year they built really nice gym and don't think they used that gym no more than three year
My name is Bonnie Rindner and was born in San Antonio TX and the story I'm going to tell is about my mothe
Um don't know if they were farmers or not but know they were land owners um many acres and um her grandmother was raised in wealt
Um she was raised in MO and she married man this is my grandmother I'm talking abou
There was no money to buy any presents at all um for the children and my grandfather who was killed when my mother was 16 this was of course way before that um he must have been very positive person because what he did with the situation was he he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselve
Um felt like that was way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with lov
And although never met my grandfather have never forgotten that story and when hear of him think what wonderful wonderful person he must have bee
And how long have you lived in Charlotte Oh have lived in Charlotte um for yea
We came here in 1986 we lived here for five years then we moved to Raleigh for seven years and now we've been back one yea
Robin Hood is uh or was way back when the home of my mother as she grew up in Alma Michiga
Um it was community that was put together by Englishmen um they were all farms and each one had name like Robin Hood or something to do with Englan
Uh there was some land that would have been so many acres per house and Robin Hood um had fond memories for my mother But the story want to tell happens more um as was little girl so it was many years late
Uh we were at my grandfather's farm which was different farm at that time but it's still in the same Alma Michigan uh are
And one of the aunts or my mother said Let's go see Robin Hood Well Robin Hood had been they moved many years ago from there uh so we all piled into the car and went to see Robin Hoo
As we drove up to Robin Hood you could tell it was left to the element
There was grass waving in the breeze and it was rather sad no paint on the house but you could see it had been beautiful home at one tim
We went up the back porch uh the well was open anyone could've fallen into the well it was in the back porch or the side porc
Went in and uh it always mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was and indeed it probably had bee
As we walked up the stairs the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze and the wallpaper was wet from the rain and the elements had been coming in for years; as we walked through the home and have fond memories of that day was probably in the fifth or sixth grade would imagin
Um we went outdoors then went into the barn and there was dead calf in the bar
Uh we ourselves lived in Grand Rapids Michigan so we went home uh from Grandpa's farm that nigh
Uh and my mother sat down probably that first week and she wrote poem and uh the poem tells lo
The poem is titled The Place of my Childhood DreamsNearer and nearer my footsteps led me Back to the place of my childhood dream
At the landing gazed out the window And there was the woods in the distance The woods where we had gathered wildflowers in the sprin
And then remembered our mother's voice calling from somewhere Children be sure to put them in water'tis cruel to pluck them and then let them wither and die Slowly as had entered walked from the home of my childhood dreams As if from some sacred tomb I'd walked down and out and into the bright sunny spring ai
From the distance the town hall clock was striking the school bell was ringing could hear from the small town awa
The sights and the sounds of the world could go on forever But the place of my childhood dreams could never again feel the same insid
So they moved to another farm and lo and behold that house also caught on fir
And Mother and Dad then purchased an old farmhouse and remodeled this farmhouse it took al took almost year to remode
It wa it was wonderful uh farm it had wonderful gardens as you might tell my mother was gardene
Um when they were still remodeling the house it was Christmastime and we still lived in the city the phone rang uh whether it did or it didn't my father said it di
And we went uh he said that we had to go out to the farm because uh someone had left the light on in the bar
And we went out and we drove up the driveway and Daddy went down to the bottom the barn and as we opened the door horse whinnie
And still can picture that with the uh the light the outdoor light of the barn and the snow coming down it was really beautifu
But uh we lived there we moved in the spring of 48 and uh February around February 10 of 1959 got call and the house was on fir
It was winter and of course there wasn't any water and uh they just had water in the tank truck and the house was gutted out as result of tha
So my mother then left our home and uh didn't have home to go to and built home in the city then uh was happy there although she was lonely I'm sur
My sister still has that piano and uh still has the best tune of any piano I've ever hear
It's been difficult but loved her Um when my mother passed away she passed away in 1992 and uh after her funeral we went out to the far
By then it someone else had built house on the same spot; what had been dirt road was then fourlane highwa
We pulled into the driveway and someone was living in the house of course and the barn was still ther
Where there had been formal garden to the left of the driveway was then woods as time had taken its tol
We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as grew u
Uh it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are and he said that they would go to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixtyseven acres and you could still feel M
And uh liked that because my father was very sensitive man although he came across as he was being very gruff he was not O
She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years and she is going to talk about growing up JapaneseAmerican in West Virgini
Um when grew up in West Virginia um it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte are
It was just uh the people were just so different there lot of coal miners and uh there's lot of people on welfar
  Where were you in West Virginia  We were growing up in Madison West Virginia and prior to that Kentuck
My father was from Kentucky and we call him The Kentucky Redneck and my mother was Japanese and when she came to the United States she couldn't speak any English or anythin
And uh so she spoke broken English and as we were being raised we learned to interpret everything she sai
And no matter what anyone uh mom would say no matter what she would say to someone we would understand exactly what she meant exactly what she was saying and they couldn't believe i
But um as we grew up our mother taught us lot about respect and how important it is to be good and kind to other people be courteous uh be thankful for all the little things that people do for yo
didn't realize she had implanted that in my head all these years until grew up and people wondered why was being so nic
And then growing up in West Virginia and being part Japanese and the only family in that area that was Japanese it was kind of difficul
Um especially when there was just handful of Native Americans then there were some African Americans just handful of them and then there was u
When they would start to cover like the WWII stories at school and in history class we would uh kind of shrink under our seats because you know everybody would start yelling Jap And uh we until then we didn't feel like we were different and then we realized after that well we looked Japanese although we were 100% America
People people would look at us and know we were different so they would treat us differen
But we would go home and my mother would always reassure us that uh it's OK to be differen
Uh went around with not so much chip on my shoulder just uh an inferiority complex and didn't realize until got older that was very much proud to be Japanes
And uh got to visit Japan couple of times and realized that's the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I'm able to help other people go through the same situatio
Um What kind of stories did your your mother used to tell you Oh Mom used to tell us stories when she was 11 years old um when World War II did hit she looked up which her home was not far from Hiroshima Wo
And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was going to die and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her lif
That but uh they made it through that and um she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people but uh she was always just grateful for her lif
And she raised us with speaking broken English and she eventually did learn English fairly wel
Um How did your parents meet They met my my mother was going to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working parttime at china factory and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother and uh he met my mother and just fell head over heels in lov
And um he just kept being nice to her and she her family couldn't believe she would leave them and move to the United States to be with this man but she di
So um as we got older we really appreciated that and uh when Mom got sick she had cancer it was our turn to take care of he
So for about six months we my sister and both we just kept we just stayed beside her bed and we took care of her and it was wonderful it was like us giving back to Mo
He died of massive heart attack when he was 48 and uh she went back that time and stayed couple month
She was able to see her mother and um get to know her family again because it had been 22 year
So uh that was wonderful and then she went one other time which was her last time uh and stayed about month and she came bac
My first trip to Japan although it was sad trip it was watershed in my lif
It was uh after she died of cancer my sister and had her cremated and we took her ashes back to be with her famil
My second trip was um to take my daughter when she turned 16 which was wonderful trip and helped her understand her grandmother's cultur
And then we plan to take my son next year when he turns 16 just so we can uh show him Japa
And we feel like travel is one of the best things you can give your childre
Money clothes and all that can go away but travel is in your memories and that when I'm dead and gone want them to remember that You mentioned that your mom talked lot about her older brothe
What were some of the stories she told about him Well Mom came from traditional Japanese family um where the Number One son does take over after the parents get to be certain ag
And um right now my uncle is almost 90 and his son is taking care of hi
She would tell us about how the people in the community always took care of their family because they were so well respected and they lived in beautiful place and people would bring them gifts because they just appreciated their presence in the communit
We would think Oh yeah right you were rich And then when did go over to Japan did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her totally believe her that that she had all this but um according to Japanese standards uh they are just very wealth
And then they come here and they look at my house and they no really land over there is so very expensive so they are very wealthy and then they come here and live in very basic house and they think I'm rich so uh that's kind of comical which we're not we're very middle class That was drastic change for her It wa
mean to go from there to wow She was pretty much treated like princess pretty much mean they catered to her family they adopted children Wo
What did your dad do in West Virginia Actually my father was um supervisor for the telephone company Hu
Which is guess why love being around telephones and fixing phones and love what do no
He uh learned lot in the Army and then think I'm the only one that kind of pursued an interest in telephones and communications and such That is interesting that it would come back around that wa
Um was there anything else your family used to do or talked about that you wanted to include Um we used to camp which was very unusual for my mother Oh be
She was Miss Prissy out there trying to camp We used to uh we used to try to act like normal American family but we would have rice at the campground never remembered day in my life that didn't have ric
If you got sick she would ball up little balls of rice and you know Just eat this you'll be OK So she thought it rice was cureal
But uh Do you eat rice now Yes have rice cooker and pretty much keep rice on all the tim
And my daughter is pursuing career in uh political science and Asian studies Huh So she can go over there and teach English in Japa
And her junior year in college she is at Furman University her junior year she plans to go over there and spend the whole year studying in Japa
You can just answer them and feel free to respond however you want to OK What stories or books do you remember reading as little person Little boy My two favorite books as child was Curious George and The Jungle Boo
Who told did did is that story your mom read to you or did you like My mom started reading it to me when was small and and picked it up on my own reading and enjoyed the illustrations as much as the boo
Were they bright books Or did they have bright pictures They all had yellow covers and they were all paperback
Not vivid pictures just They weren't real bright colors were they And the whole page wasn't colore
That's neat All right um well what about that book that your mama bought you that time that she told briefly that stor
Because she purchased book for me and my brother and um it was publishing company that could add your names and your friend's names and family names into the into the plot of the stor
And it really brought home um events of the book to you because it was personal and it was it was individualisti
Who were you Do you remember what character you played was just one of the jungle boys who went through and had interaction with each of the members of The Jungle Boo
Who would you consider the best storyteller in your family The best storyteller would be my grandfather my mother's fathe
Because he he grew up um one of six children and so that just adds to his storytelling and imagination and his he's always had interaction with people so that just adds to how he interacts with people no
Do you remember any one particular story that he told You can't think of story Not um right of
know the story he tells about well he's always telling about going to play music and how they'd play when he was youn
So can you think of story can remember story that really is humorous in way because he always tells story about how he used to double date with his future wife and my mother which is his daughter and my dad because unfortunately his wife passed away when when she was really young so So Eileen and him double dated with your mom and dad Righ
He would talk about how he would ask um he would always try to get my dad to end up paying for all four of them's dinne
It's hard to imagine your your grandparents double dating with your parents but you know that was unique situatio
Um how does he tell when he tells those stories like does he usually tell them at family gatherings How does he do it Most of the time it's during family gathering
He's always got story to tell regardless if he sees you or if it's family gatherin
He's got you know he's going to be the one that's got the one who is keeping the crowd up or or you know just being himsel
What about you What do you when we you and I since we are husband and wife when we have kids do you imagine yourself as that kind of person Like that kind of storyteller Like Grandpa George and Lemmie Do you see yourself like that Probably don't know some to degre
So think I'd probably be little bit of him yet little bit of everybody else and I'm not really one to steal the steal the show at gatherings or what have yo
If you were going to tell story to your kids about your childhood what story would you tell It would probably all be sports related stories um because sports to me has been such big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of um in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right one
Well think maybe you are ah trying to preface some story about getting thrown out of gam
Well um there have been times when me and my friends have gotten into little bit of troubl
Who was your archrival The team from the northern part of our county North Stokes and we were the southern part South Stoke
And uh they had one pitcher in particular who didn't like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time we kind of decided that we were going take it upon ourselves to hit bac
Um so you know things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and matur
So what you going to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with baseball Charge the mound I've been there and know what isn't necessarily the right decisio
What about what is your worst memory not your worst as in bad but just the worst kind of memorable memory you have about playing sports all through your life Well the good thing about sports is you can remember one thing that occurs or it or it can be collection of memorie
And lot what have are collection of memories because when you play for 21 years of your life in sports like have um really what stands out is just year to yea
So many things can happen over the course of year that or over the course of that many years nothing stands out in particular it is just bunch of fond memorie
Well if you had how do you think you got started in sports What was your family's connection to you in sports Like Jeff your brother and Denise and your dad and mom Well the funny thing is my parents were both athletic in high schoo
But when it came to my older brother and older sister neither one of them part participated in sport
It was just the kind of thing where um in kindergarten or even before kindergarten it just it just came to me that wanted to play tee ball and from there it starte
And after that asked to put up hoop in our backyard and luckily had plenty of of children my age to play with and that used to be the ritual have the neighborhood kids come over to my hoop and we'd play basketball and it ended up was playing with lot of older kids and so developed an athletic ability through playing with the neighborhood kids in basketball and just starting so early and continuing on in basebal
So Jeff or Denise neither one you don't have any memories of playing with them in the yard would play with them in the yard but they never played any organized sport
My sister is quite older than am so she and I as far as playing sports together you know that was few and far betwee
But my brother and would play basketball in the yard or play baseball and we used to play lot of kickball in our yard because we had big yard and lot of kids so we were always coming up with somethin
What about hmm your daddy My dad would always play too um he was always just one of the kid
Um because we had you know when was 10 or 12 we'd play against kids who were 14 16 and my brother was about seven years older and he would come out and play and so it was just kind of natural for my dad to fit in and play alon
And uh he was always good too and he was one of the reasons he made me good in what was doing because he would challenge m
Of course he was about 6'2 when was growing up at 10 or 12 years old so he he would challenge me to get bette
Um what's the best memory you have with your daddy and sports because know your daddy's MS Well important to yo
Well they always say that some of the bad things are what stands out and not necessarily bad thing but it is one of my best memories is a
Well my dad was diagnosed with cancer right before baseball season my senior year and it didn't keep him from coming to any of the baseball games thoug
can remember him just in in the months prior just prior to when he died it was like it took every ounce of energy he had to show up at the baseball games but nothing kept him from showing u
Like said you don't remember one thing in particular you remember things collectively and remember that season collectively and him making that effort to show up at the game
That last year don't have any of those because he wasn't able to do it but all of my baseball and basketball games prior to that he wanted to videotape them fo
It started out as Well if videotape them and we take them home and watch them you can watch each tape and you can analyze what you need to do to get bette
And you can also show those to your coach and you know he can view the team and see what they need to do to get better But you know it just turned into something that will always have those collection of tapes such memorie
Both hearing his voice on them screaming at the refs or screaming at me cheering and what have yo
mean relative to everybody else was good in basketball but you know that can't really compare to Jerry Stackhouse or anybody like tha
When you add six inches to me it makes it little bit tougher for me to compet
So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid I'm probably not going to push any sport on our kid my kid although have always said when was in college and right after gave up my sports career always said my kid I'm going to teach him more and work with him all the tim
But as I've grown older and matured I've decided I'm going to let my kid be who he wants to b
Yeah Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in N
Your little wrecked 84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away especially two hours to come and see m
But um one of the things remember was you putting it putting yourself getting in trouble and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever don
Putting your personal safety on the line when you took off two hours up to my house against your parent's knowin
And uh and we had nice dinner and we went out to movie and What movie did we see don't even remember the movi
just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have ha
And of course one of the things remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official unofficial dat
Well we ah had just broken up with my girlfriend of on and off girlfriend of two and half to three years and you were supposedly dating guy in the Navy stationed in San Dieg
kind of long distance relationship And my um fraternity was having cocktail and I of course needed someone to go with since didn't have a uh girlfriend at the tim
And all my friends said Why don't you ask Kristi Why don't you ask Kristi Because we had bunch of mutual friends in the fraternity and Which one pushed you the most Morgan Collin
Hum Morgy And um so we ended up going out but didn't have any idea that you did have boyfriend But told them to tell Nobody told m
And so was looking at it as date whereas she was looking at it as a night out just to get out and do thing
don't know don't remember if you ended up telling me at some point during the night if you had boyfriend um but it really didn't slow me down an
guess it got to you little bit because we ended up eventually Eventually Yeah told you had boyfriend on the couch remember You listened to the Christmas music too much maybe little bit too muc
He was one of the most reserved people you will ever meet and ah he was 84 when he passed away and he was about 5'10 and he never weighed over hundred thirtyfive pound
He grew up as farmer tobacco farmer and the thing about it is that he smoked nonfiltered Camels since the time he was 15 years old and he passed away at the age of 85 with the cleanest lungs but I'm sure it didn't make the rest of his body too health
That's your daddy When my dad passed away in 1992 it wasn't long after that he deteriorate
Um pretty much to nothing because he ah he had lost major part of his life and it really brought him down but he didn't necessarily he wasn't one of the most talkative peopl
If you talked to him it was like pulling teeth sometimes but he would do anything in the world for yo
Um he would always go the extra mile he just didn't do it with words he did it with action
Did you ever remember him playing was he sports guy Did he play sports with you or anything Not really hmm he grew up on farm and you know playing sports was um and he was so much older that was he wasn't really in the best of health when was growing u
Um of course we would go up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and uh he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play but he never really participated because he was 70 years older you know 70 years older than wa
All of my neighbors and family members grew up on farms and and as child in the summer when you weren't playing sports you were farming or working in tobacco to make mone
And then did you sell it mean is that what your grandpa did Then the owners would take it to the to the tobacco warehouse and then they would auction it off and sell it per poun
And that's what their uh that's what their way of living was was to sell that tobacc
Hmm that's all your grandpas ever did Well that's what they did until they became 55 or 60 years old and then my late grandfather Lemmie went to work in textile mill as supervisor and my grandfather Willis went to work in furniture factor
Um what about your um childhood with your brother and sister What is the funniest story that you remember with your brother and sister as child I've heard couple but My sister was always the little tyran
And during the summer when we were home from school and was five or six years old when they were both still hom
She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played part in that and of course she was going to make sure we did our par
So she was the biggest slave driver I've ever seen and my brother was always the rebel and I you know as five or six year old did what could and she didn't really have lot of trouble with me but with my brother being when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they ha
She always had this thing about when we rebelled she would lock us in two separate bedroom
don't know what we did necessarily that day but he climbed out the window and was running aroun
Well it does Me But anyway he climbed out window and came by my window and my window was several feet off the ground so it wasn't like could escap
But he would throw rocks up to get my attention and he saw me look out the window and he was jumping up and down waving his arms and laughing because he was out and was still i
And and the first thing saw him do was hit the ground holding his feet so he kind of got what he deserved that day Um showing off little bit hmm base but they had their share of fight
Did he get caught Yeah he got caught And got locked back in with a with sore foo
Well you were perfect you never did anything What about the hole in the wall Well that's different story Huh Yeah that's what thought All right uh what about um your mom Tell me some funny stories about your mo
The funny think one of the most humorous things about her if you know my mom she's uh 56 now and to imagine her with this patented hook shot on the basketball team and uh the allstar of the of the Stokes County Basketball League as senior in high school is pretty funny And she used to demonstrate that for me to
We would go out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt because she had that hook shot that nobody else could do In her high heel shoes In her high heel shoes Um well O
Anything else that you want to add to your interview OK thank you and now you are always on tape O
Is there anything you want to talk about in relate relating to Charlotte or any particular stories you would like to share Um well when was about 15 had to move from one part of Charlotte to another and it was very hard experience for me because um my mother had was remarried um because my father had died few years prior to thi
So um my family life was already kind of disrupted so being pulled away from all my friends um really tore part of my life up because was leaving you know the best group of friends that I'd even known and I'd grown up with them from like elementary school to high schoo
She sent me to like frigging shrink to um help maybe you know sort through my emotions or whateve
Um so uh but what but actually my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me oddly enough um because when moved um met like you know close friends that actually now go to college with and who was roommate with for year or s
Um so even though it was kind of scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew um it gave me the chance to see that change is good and that um seeing different part of you know just different parts of the same town it's still very beneficial because it gave me the chance to realize how to adapt to different situations into different environment relatively quickl
Um because ended up making lot of good friends and um really loving the part of town that moved to and really adapting to um my community there um and getting involve
And actually the friends that made there are the ones ended up going to college with and not the ones from my first high schoo
So um Do you feel it made it easier for you to adapt to college life because of the move Definitel
Whereas lot of my friends had never even been in different situation in different group of friends from the ones they had known from elementary schoo
Whereas I'd already had this type of thing in my life so was more think was quicker to adapt to different college surrounding
Do you feel that it was hard being the new person in school mean were people really did they don't know how to put i
They didn't like me at first cause was the new girl and where you know most of the guys if new girl comes in of course they're going to be friendly just because it's new blood or whateve
Um so it really took them probably I'd say at least three months before I'd actually consider them my friends because I'd have classes with um Stephanie who is one of my good friends now but she did not talk to me for the first three month
Even though don't think it was because of anything I'd done because had hardly said two words since didn't know anybody but um they were real coy towards me you kno
But it Why do you think that is Why do you thing do you think that's just girls in general Actually think it is most girls in genera
It's just natural thing if you if you have certain guy friends that you become very possessive over and you see someone whether it's their new girlfriend or their new best friend or whatever comes in and takes up some of your time think it's just human nature to get jealous and to kind of put up a you know an offensive front to whoever the invader or the intruder i
So think I've probably done the some time in my life so don't have any hard feelings towards the
And you feel it was good thing overall the whole experience of moving and being the new kid and Absolutely wouldn't trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences from like new ideas and new situations and so think it's kind of blessing that had the chance to go through this in the kind of um be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd you kno
Because mean think lot of people who have never been on the outside don't understand what it's like to be kind of the kid that's you know not M
Popularity you know Who doesn't have all the friends and who doesn't get all the attention and so it was nice because you know in school like had good circle of friends was always you know an athlete or whatever so you know received the attentio
But for those few months that was the outsider really got to see what it was like you know to not be you know cool or whateve
Is there anything else you'd like to say or Umm other than it was good experience that's about i
Uh what stories do you remember that your family members used to tell you Um stories about when they were littl
Any that you remember Not really because was think was too young when they told me that don't exactly remembe
But like my mother's mother my grandmother she like told us about how when she was very young and her mother die so she had to go and work and help her famil
My mom used to tell us stories at night and they were sort of like be made up stories that she like made up sort of about the day so she used me and my sister's name in it and they'd be funny because they weren't true but they had like was character in them and so was my sister and we can be anything from animals to human
And it sort of told about what you did during the day and how you acte
Did you enjoy those stories did Um do you remember at what time she used to say that Well before we went to be

Do you remember how your bedroom used to look when you were that that young N
What about books Do you remember reading books when you were young Um in kindergarten at five my kindergarten teacher Mr
Thorpe started teaching us how to read and the alphabet and so we used to have these um little books that had like sentence or less per page and it had like really big big picture on every single pag
So if you didn't understand what it said you could sort of comprehend with the picture and that got me interested in reading mor

And one of them was that one time wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said my mom said to get to find way to get it and so don't remember what grabbed but grabbed something and climbed on top of the bed and grabbed the thing that wanted and think they were like surprised because they didn't think that would actually do i
Another one was when think was younger than that was trying to climb up on couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody she's going to fall she's going to fall she's going to fall she fell because did fall and everybody laughed and think they took picture of me when was like climbing up the couch or whenever was on that couc
But they sort of told me that from climbing all over the couches sort of ruined the

And then my dad told me about time when he climbed up on the window and my grandmother came out and look at him and scared him and he fell down and rolled down the street because it was stee
And and he talked about time that he was trying to cut tree or something and he cut his knee ope
But remember when my dad said he fell down and he hit his head in the like river because he dived in and my grandmother dived in the same place and she hit herself there to
She would make up stories for us my sister and I at bedtime when we lived in Miami and she would tell us stories like including like characters that were like us but we had different names and stuff or we would be animals and they would have morals to them at the end and or we would read books at night before going to be
It had bed where you pull another bed out from under it and it had one of those like porch outside of it and it was big room and when you came in the front door to the apartment it would be down the left hallwa
And do you remember stories about maybe somebody else in the family Maybe that you can tell Oh yeah My sister when she was like four she went into the walkin closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothe
And also in that same walkin closet my sister and I we would go in there and hide from my dad and when he got home from work and we would wait for him to come in and turn on the light and then when he walked in we'd scare hi

What kind of stories were told to you as child We have family picture of me and my brother and sister sitting on the couch with my mother reading us stor
Um don't remember stories from my mother reading them It was stand up big radio we didn't have TV at this time and sat leaning on the radio listening to my favorite The Shadow Only the Shadow Knows mystery story every wee
remember one night though having to walk up the street to the farmhouse to get mil
It was Christmastime and it was cold and being bundled up walked at nighttime slowly up the stree
slowly looked up at the moon and saw gold sleigh and Santa approaching the left side of the moo
was surprised and did not believe what was seeing so paused and gazed in awe that actually saw Santa and the sleigh couldn't get it out of my mind as continued my wal
was told by friend there was no Santa that really bothered me so asked my dad one night during the Christmas seaso
He had way of speaking with strong voice that we never questioned when he used i
And when he when told him what my friend said he sat me down saying That is not true there is Santa in that voice we never questione
Your friend is wrong and let me tell you why And he just proceeded with his loving logic and questions to prove to me there really was Sant
Everything he said made sense to me and could feel myself well up inside with pride and love for my father and felt so good and happy that my friend was now wrong and was right and there really was Santa and that Santa was in my heart and mind no
Which one was your favorite story That was my favorite story it was the most impactful stor
And to this day can still remember feeling so proud that my dad convinced me and all those feelings of believing that that was true and can still feel that toda
What kind of books did you read to your children Where did you read them Why did you read them Well u
Seuss and did lot of books on feelings about being sad happy neat and angry and things like that um so they could understand the feelings at those level
And um got books like transactional analysis which they called TA for tots and I'm OK You're OK um gamut of fairytales uh like The Three Little Pigs and things like that every love children's books and every children's book could get brought for the kid
read to them at bedtime uh in their beds other times they sat in my lap during the day um like going over the pictures the sounds and the tone of voice uh through me um as to what the character was feeling scared happy angr
When felt like it um it would be effective and my children's behavior said They were really into this story at that point then would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interes
Um being each character myself as read added added more excitement for them and for m
Sometimes we'd lay on the carpet and read and I'd follow their interest when to stop and when to start and when sometimes to turn the pag
Um read at bedtime as calming down for all of us being together and ending our da
Sitting on the couch with them uh gave me the feeling of closeness and the uh children's closeness or bonding with m
Um and when we read was whenever anybody wanted to read and sometimes would introduce new book to them and say have new story for yo
What kind of stories did you tell your children Do you recall any of them Oh yeah oh yeah recall the
At bedtime um when all were in the same bed and that's where they had to be for these storie
Um usually made up story according to what they were feeling at different points in their live
Their favorite was The WoodMonster uh sometimes the kids felt like running away from home and whatever would pick up with the kids that they were issuing is what would make story out of and to get my point across to them to
Um this this story involved this WoodMonster story involved kids that uh felt like running away from home and this story involved kids who decided to do just that one late nigh
Um they sneaked out of their bedroom windows and they all met and went into the wood
Um as they thought this was really cool and they were sitting under big tree in the woods the branches started moving the kids thinking uh that the wind was doing it but when the branches started to slowly come down and start touching them they got scared and the branches were trying to wrap around them then the trunk of the tree started bending als
They discovered as they ran by each tree in the woods that all the trees were alive and wanting to attach their branches around the
So they finally all decided that this was not the thing and they got back into the house uh through their window and felt the safe warm comfort of their beds and vowed never to do that agai
And also certain stuffed animals my kids had were um were also made alive by m
When they got thrown on the floor and not cared about made up story about how the animal felt being treated that way when it loved them so much and wanted to be snuggled up by them at night played the animal of course and then with your arms around it still do this once and awhile with my adult childre
One of my children was really drawn into this story and today she is very sensitive and compassionate with animal
Um also sent my young adult children Easter bunnies and the loving message that went with it uh was from the bunn
Like this bunny talked with me at the store and he was so sweet and loving and really wanted to be with one of you one of my kids and not left on the shelf in the store all by himself so would create that kind of story and attach it to the bunnies and send them to my childre
Do you read stories now And If so what kind Um some of them are made into stories um see for the past maybe 2530 years I've read many new age books uh from channeling to personal stories by the authors relating to their major life change
All of my reading basically involved selfimprovement at each level of my growth um including spiritual growt
read all of these books to help me be more effective parent person manager and spiritual bein
Um my best reading time was in bed where had no interruptions um and then could focus on the informatio
And still send my adult children books on topics think they could gain deeper insight t
Um it through that book it was me going through all the same experiences as the author and saw more clearly what needed to d
was the lady with the two daughters and he was the man with the two son
We had each been divorced for while and we each were too busy to do any dating or meeting of perspective mate
So my daughter Michaela had group of friends affectionately called The Quail Girls and his son Ryan had group of friends won't tell you what we'd name them but anyway they were normal high school seniors and both of the children were seniors at South Mecklenburg High School at the same tim
One of the girls in Michaela's group Shelle just got an inspiration one day when she was staring out window riding down the road and she said Chaela We need to get your mom to meet Ryan Speckman's dad And Michaela said Really Cause she was of course very protective of her mo
So finally Michaela said Well maybe that will work And all of the other girls are saying Yeah yeah yeah So that was when the idea was bor
And for the next few months Michaela kept saying You know Mom you need to meet M
Speckman because he's single and all he has time for is his job and the boy
He's really cute and he's really nice guy and he's real involved with the kids said Well if he is really cute and he's really nice guy then I'm sure that he's got girlfriend And she said No no n
just know he doesn't because the girls say he doesn't and he never goes to the games with anybody and you need to meet M
Speckman So then would forget about it and the girls would come over and they would say M
Speckman So um soccer game would come up because the boys played soccer the Speckman boys played socce
Michaela would say How about it Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night And had an evening job and would say Well no can't go Thursday So then few more games would go by um could go to the game but she couldn't go to the game and next time she could go to the game then couldn't go to the game and she would say Well M
So um there was at the end of the sports season the fall sport season and the spring sport season at South Mecklenburg there was always what they called banquet and they didn't serve any food but for some reason they called it banque
They had all the children the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced get whatever recognition were appropriate and um there was going to be one in early December of 199
And uh that was when it was decided since was going to be there because Michaela played tennis in the fall and M
Speckman was going to be there since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take plac
So in order to make sure that would be there one of the Quail Girls who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans said she would come and she would pick me u
Michaela couldn't drive me because she had to be there early to be in this progra
So Michaela helped me pick out what was supposed to wear and uh Wendy came to pick me u
And you have to understand Wendy is this she's wonderful girl but she's kind of silly gir
She's always like Ha uh ha uh So Wendy came to pick me up and was all nervous and everything which was ridiculou
And um when we got there uh we s sat with Wendy's parents who again live around the corner from M
They said this is uh Wendy's mother said to me Oh You're going to meet John Speckman Whew hope this works out You've got good taste I'm like Oh boy What am getting myself into So Wendy and sat down and were just kind you know of chattin
She's squirming and looking all around and everything and the program started and it's quiet and all of sudden she says There he is Right over there right over there said Sssh So anyway got got chance to take look at M
Speckman and um he looked just like Michaela had described so through the whole thing kind of did an analysis of you know do or do not want to meet M
Speckman but felt like would let Michaela and all of the girls down if did no
And she came and uh came with me to the little lobby of the auditorium where they were serving foo
So all the Quail Girls and were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever and the guys and M
So uh you know Wendy was saying How are we going to do this How are we going to do this And said Well you know if it happens it happen
If it doesn't happen I'll I'll you know it can happen at another time I'm sur
So said to Michaela after about five or 10 more minutes You know maybe this isn't the right tim
Let's just leave and and you know I'll I'll just meet him another time And all of sudden got this tap on the shoulder and turned around and looked up into the eyes of this high school boy and it was Ryan Speckma
And he said Don't you want to meet him And fell in love with Ryan Speckman first and said Well sure So he went and he got him and walked in that direction and M
So the next th OK that was the Monday of Thanksgiving week so had to work the day after Thanksgiving in the medical clinic where worked and it was crazy crazy crazy day and Michaela called me in the middle of the day this was on Friday and she said Guess who called and left message And said Who And she said M
Speckman And said You're kidding And she said Are you going to call him Are you going to call him Are you going to call him So said Yeah I'll call him So went home that night called him left him message he wasn't ther
So couple of days later get home from work again in the evening and there was message that said Call me back whatever time So called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Frida
So called and talked to Michaela and said Well we're going out to eat And she said I knew it knew it knew it Ryan came up to me at school and he said He called her think they're going to go out And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said He called her and he's going to ask her out So everybody knew before knew that he called me and was going to ask me out So Friday came and we were supposed to go ou
came home from work so there was message and on the voice mail was Shelle the girl who had this brainstorm to begin with and she said Hi This is Shelle Just wanted to tell you good luck tonigh
Don't be nervous You'll be fine And I'm like I'm old enough to be your mother I'm sure I'll be fine So everybody's eager to find out what's happening on this dat
So um Michaela was going out and had instructions to call her as soon as got home to beep her as soon as got home so we could discuss the dat
Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go and so we went there to ea
And the whole evening was talk the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryan's friend
And they had cleaned out the car they called him at work and made sure that he was there in time for the date so mean we had lovely evening lovely evenin
And um just talked about how funny it was that these kids were trying to to make us mee
So the next day um Michaela yeah called Michaela and she said What did you think What did you think said You know he's very nice man but he is so busy with his business and with his two boys that don't even think he's even got time for another date but he he is very nic

June of 97 we got married and our wedding party was the Quinn girls and the Speckman boys and the guest list was the Quail Girls and all of Ryan's friends and they all lived happily ever afte
Um was born in Charlotte NC and moved to Monroe um which is about fortyfive minutes east of Charlotte um when was about thre
moved back to Charlotte to go to college and stayed there for four years and am still ther
And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so we're all really close and pretty tight and um I'm real I'm closer with my grandmother um which is my mom's mother and um we do lot of stuff together go shopping and go to lunch and stuff everyda
I OK I um have lot of cats and have lot of dogs and so love animals lo

But um we left them there by themselves with uh well like bowl of food out which usually we don't do but we were going to go get some lunch and um we were gone for probably about twenty minute
And we came back and Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog uh but when we came back we saw that Mongoose uh was bleeding from her eye
Tanya had ripped her eye out had bitten her eyeball out um obviously over the food that we had left out on the floo
And so obviously was totally devastated and my mom was too and so we rushed her to the vet and um they everything was O
Like they were able to save her but they couldn't put her eye back in so they just kind of sewed it up and eventually it grew hair back over i
So it was pretty it was funny but she lived for another six years at leas
And but she did fine after that with just one eye but um let's see guess Do you have any memories about many trips you used to take when you were little Like to the beach or something Um yeah well um we my aunt Bebe had beach hous

And when it was time to go to the beach together it was just like it was like great We couldn't ever replace i
So but uh guess that's the What would you do when you were at the beach What was your favorite place Well we would all well our favorite place mean we were pretty young so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or going to walk on the strip or somethin
But um we you know during the day it was always the beach going to the beach and playing on the beach and laying out and then going shopping at the um like Broadway at the Beach or um Barefoot Landin
And we'd usually shop during the day and then at night we'd sit well food is like the main thing for our famil
So but um at night we'd always go to dinner and um to the Pavilion or else to go to the Grand Prix or is that what it's called And um stuff like tha
Like the adults would always take us places and let us go and ride rides and stuff like that and we'd all go together as big group and it was just lot of fu
But um Was it your your grandmother does she she sort of you said she kind of heads up the whole thing Oh yea
She makes sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Labor Day and New Year's Day and everythin

Um like It's not worth something something Oh um yeah but my grandmother she yeah she's got some funny saying
Like she'll well she when she's referring to my cousin Michael he's kind of like he's kind of the guess the black sheep of the famil
You know just he's my cousin and he's year older than me but he can't he can't keep job and he's just got 
But she always says that he's not worth the powder to take to blow his ass away So But um you know it's pretty funny of course he doesn't he doesn't think it it's funny but she that's her favorite thing to sa
She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too ba
But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's going to have to b
But um um so my next story guess want to talk about uh guess I'll move on to kind of high school er
Um we were it was guess there were probably about maybe seven or eight of us but was the only gir
We were always out kind of doing boy stuff and guess wasn't really like tomboy but did like to go fishing and hang out with the guys and stuf
But anyway um we were riding um there were probably about eight of us and we were riding in the back of the truc
And um we were going to Lake Twitty and kind of just got volunteered into going with everybod
And um so anyway we were just riding along and we pulled into uh and oh Something that left out Daniel had light that he had would like big flashlight that he was shining and um not flashlight spotlight and it had blue light in it and he was kind of flashing it around and just playing around with i
And um we pulled into the road that takes us to the lake and all of sudden we car followed us uh followed in behind us and it was like 300Z
And um we pulled in and we stopped and he got out and but just he was just kind of we couldn't see him because he had he had his lights on his bright
And um he said Why don't you why don't you point that thing over here to see what got And uh he had he had gu
And well come to find out he was police officer but he was offduty and he was in an unmarked ca
But um he had told us that um So he says to us that um he shows us his gun and he said that he had he almost shot u
And he acted really nervous and jittery and he acted like he came up to the car kind of close and he acted like he did want to shoot u
And um he but he didn't really care that we had that we had um beer and he didn't mind that we were all under age or he didn't even know because none of us were of ag
And so you know he didn't act like he really wanted to fill any papers on us or anythin
We didn't find this out till probably about 10 or 15 minutes later until he was about to leav
But we found out probably about year later or we saw on the news that was year later he had been arrested for um murdering girl um in in Monro
So Eric would you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as child What was your favorite story Uh my favorite book or stories were the uh phew The Cat in the Hat because always loved all of the color
And there's always all of the kids were having great time while the parents left and it was like one big huge flight of fancy and they just go from one thing to another thing and it was like really fun and chaotic and just nea
And then and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of sudden toward the end like the parents are coming bac
And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're going to get punishe
And so it was like Can they do it Can they do it Can they get cleaned up in time Are they going to make it So it's like having blast and going on flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught kind o
would be this is more like when was eight nine and ten and 11 would have bedtime and it was always way earlier than wanted but would lay would have this little lamp I'd put underneath my bedcovers and would be readin
loved baseball still do but uh you know just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of her
And uh every once in while think my dad caught onto that but uh he'd come down and tell me to shut the shut the lamp off every once in whil
So what baseball hero did you want to be when you grew up Oh wanted to be uh Harmon Killebrew because was from M
And then when I'd play baseball I could hit pretty good too when was real youn
And they never hit but uh always loved biographies of of famous people and events in history as got olde
Also some of these other questions that also leads to the fact that uh my brother you know had seven or six brothers and sisters four until was 11 and then three more joined the family when was 1
And remember his stories too because he would just make them up and just it would just be zanines
And yet he was he was really funny too and he could make faces and really creative even as little ki
But it was blast to hear him tell stories and then just start building off of them and just go all over the plac
Now good as get older really good storyteller is my other brother who is like really seriou
But he tells good story with dry sense of humor and uh golly he spent his career in the Army still; he just went to German
remember my dad my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually usually from him that that doesn't really come until late
But uh when he would start telling about when he was teenager some of the some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dad's business my grandfathe
How hard it was how hard it is you know way back then they would drive halfton truck
They were only halfton trucks and they would drive grain feed around and coal and stuff to the farmers in MN in southern M
But they would the father my grandfather wanted to save money so he would rig them up so they'd haul he'd haul ton and half on halfton truc
And so he was constantly busting up and twisting up axles and he always he would get mad when the sons would do it Uhhu
But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called i
The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and uh this was in rural MN so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts you kno
It was all fun and teenaged fun until you until you ended up in ditch in the middle of blizzar
You broke the radiator or twisted an axle of truck and had to call your dad and tell him what happene
 And top of that  of course all the dad all the grandfather wanted he wanted the customer service
Of course you're in the ditch trying to explain what happened but uh Was that your dad or his brother Bot
What year do you think that would have been That was probably uh golly my dad was born in 192
So when he was 15 and 16ish probably the early 40s as best can tell from those stories because they both went into the service very late; my dad went into the service at the very end of World War II and my uncle served in Kore
tell you don't really remember anyone reading stories to me that's although know my mom di
What are some stories that you might tell yourself now that to help you through hard times Well now now the two stories would always be uh would be the story of Joseph in the Old Testament or and or the story of Paul in the New Testamen
Which is in Joseph throughout his life he was basically done wrong by his brothers and jailed unfairly and so on and so forth but in the end no matter he didn't pay back his brothers even though he was the second most powerful man in Egyp
He just said you know the moral of the story and what he said was You meant evil for me but the Lord meant goo
That might save you know that many might be saved Uh and that's been huge huge blessing and and source of comfor
Especially in the midst of trials that uh no matter what's happening it's being done to uh for our for our good and our and our uh perfection meaning meaning that uh he's sanding off the edges constantly of u
And uh also the story of Paul and in particular it's in think it's in the Book of Romans Romans 828 where he says All things work for good for those who love the Lord Uh and Paul Paul's life is like Indiana Jones movie where at one time there's 40 40 Jews uh Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger; until they caught him they weren't going to ea
So you reckon at least one of them is going to catch them somehow but he he managed to elude them al
And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up and uh I'm sure verbally abused and just you name i
But he counted all that joy uh for the work he was doing for the Lor
And and that no matter what was happening he was able he was able to uh mentally adjust to the situation knowing that the Lord was working in his life uh for his good even if he couldn't always exactly see wh
And then of course the story of Jesus is the other one uh the biggest uh just about what he took on himself and that he was you know he was betrayed by everybody his closest closest friends uh and loved ones uh down to the last the last disciple and apostl
Uh and yet he you know he still carried through with the Father's will uh and and kept his composure and and his perspective and focused no matter wha
So those are the three that no matter what the situation there'll be something in those three lives that speak to me that will repeat to myself no matter wha
Through difficult times The harder it gets the more will reflect on those lives and go back to the passages that talk about their live
It happened three years ago and it's been amazing journeys I'm looking forward to the rest of i
grew up in small town east of Charlotte Hamlet There are only 5000 people there and in the 50's it was great place to grow u
We didn't think of it as right or wrong it was just the way things wer
The biggest prejudice that we saw exercised at the schools the children that lived out of town were called bus children and they were brought into town on bus and they were grouped together in clas
They had to come earlier in the morning and had to stay later in the afternoon and most of them were poor because if you tried to farm in the sand hills of NC it was pretty hard to make livin
There was nowhere in town that you couldn't ride on bicycle or walk as long as you told your mother where you were going and you were home by dar
wish that my children growing up in different age where they didn't have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didn't look out for them could have had this experience of this much freedo
To be able to go into the woods on the edge of town and play without anybody worrying about me was wonderful gif
And we had time to explore and imagine and do things without adult supervision which were totally innocent and great fu
There were many interesting characters in this small town two of whom lived across the street from m
These were identical twins who had dressed alike probably since the they day they were bor
By the time was child they were well into middle age and were the most incredibly nosy people in this entire tow
They went to the same church we went to First Methodist and they sat on certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pe
They could tell you who everyone was dating and if you were girl whether or not you got goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several week
She was good deal older than most people thought she was and she just didn't ever want that to be made publi
She had made me promise that when she died that her age would not be put in the newspape
She had been with us during her last illness about six or eight weeks where we were living in VA and died ther
When we came home for the funeral we had not been in the house more than five minutes and here come the Lann twins across the stree
The first words out of their mouths or out of one of them's mouths and their names were Augusta and Virginia and never knew who was who so don't know who asked the questio
The first thing one of them asked was Kitty's age was not in the newspaper how old was she said Kitty didn't tell her age when she was alive and just don't think we're going to start now They were not even put off and did not even slow dow
The next thing they wanted to know was going to sell the things in mother's house and how much did want for the mirror above the fireplac
It guess it was somewhat reassuring even then that it didn't matter that they didn't express sympathy but that some things never change and always stay the sam
Mother always enjoyed telling me stories of how she spent her summer as summers as young chil
Mother was raised not far from the square in Charlotte which is very center of Trade and Tryon Stree
She had neighbors and church close by and the trolley stopped not far from her hom
When summer arrived with the steamy hot weather the family would pack up and go out to the country to the river the Catawba Rive
This meant packing tent with cots for sleeping pots to use over an open fire dishes because of course there were no paper product at that time food and most important of all cane pole pole to go fishin
They would set out in an old car up Highway 16 to Shuffletown then down long dirt road till they came to the creek be
There they would set up camp near the creek for washing spring for drinking the river was not far down the roa
My great grandmother who was in big wooden wheelchair paralyzed with arthritis would go on this camping trip for the whole summer als
Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods wading in the creek swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and going fishin
When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she ha
Thank goodness this happened shortly before their return to the city where she could got another pai
All of Mother's life she loved to go barefooted she loved to go fishing for the small perch that she would fry with grits and the rain falling at nigh
When they were camping at the river my grandfather would trap beavers and there were beaver dam
Like the Catawba River and he would trap beaver and then he would come and he would skin the
And bring them back to Charlotte and sell them but in an a especially to the haberdasheries is that hot oh hat manufacture
 So he trapped the beavers just for the hide to make hats so he could make fashionable hats for the ladie
Still there it's not uh dusty dirty road now it's paved road now with several very very expensive it's still preserved some the old beautiful houses on i
But this was the entertainment and don't know how grandmother did it looking after her mother in wheelchai
Yeah um And the tent was big tent and suppose it was made out of canva
Her uh she lived in city until the late 1920's when uh her father my grandfather lost his jo
And the next job that he found was with the Charlotte Water Department and uh had to move to the Water Department and that was about six miles from the center of the city and it was like the countr
Most of the roads were dirt roads and uh was far away from any public transportatio
And one day in the summertime her good friend named Jackie had come from the cit
Jackie had been neighbor of Mother's and she had come to from the city out to the country to visit with Mothe
And they were playing and they decided that they would go and pick up Jackie's sister who was at Jackie's house in the cit
And they hooked it up to pony and they went riding towards Charlotte in the pony car
They got just to the edge of the city uh when something spooked the pony and the pony reared up and when he reared up the uh cart turned ove
Well it ended up with the pony found his way with the cart behind it back to the house out in the countr
But there was Mother and Jackie halfway between town and halfway between the country house having to walk all the way and of course they were all scuffed up and their clothes were all dirty and they were reprimanded when they uh arrived back hom
  While your mother and Jackie were just left in the middle of the way and have to walk all the way bac
Well we will tell story about the my mother and her sister and my grandfather grandmother and the other five children went down to Chattanooga where they had been raised in place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroa
Uh so they had families and friends and they would go back and forth and visit and drive from Charlotte to Chattanooga TN and bac
Um the one day were coming back coming down the highway uh they ran into some chickens and evidently hit chicken and drove them back to Charlotte some distance and when they go home from GA coming back through GA they got out of the car and there was chicken uh dead up against the radiator of the ca
So naturally they got out of the car took the chicken and plucked the chicken and boiled uh it and cooked it and had it for supper that nigh
The other is story about our history of was married um Kaye and she seemed quiet young lady from wellreserved family Presbyterian heritag
He had an uncle out in CA and so he rode his motorcycle from Charlotte NC up to CA um not sure but maybe in Los Angeles are
He was serving on what we used to call chain gang and take your leg put clip around it and chain ball on one end and then give you shovel or rake or pick he'd go out and maintain the highway
Well my wife's father found where his uncle was located and where he was working So in an opportune time he rode his motorcycle and got his uncle to hop on the back of the motorcycle and they headed for N
And so he helped his uncle escape the chain gang and after they got back in NC his uncle became sick and within about three months uh died from tuberculosi
And that's story of my wife side of family not story from my side of the famil
To uh that didn't have orphanages and things and so when family parents would die or someone couldn't take care of the childre
He had some other brothers and sisters and they went to other homes but when his parents die
Great grandmother did not have any children so they adopted my grandfather and they had large farm uh and my great grandfather was very industriou
And so they farmed the farm and then they set up touring company and they bought automobiles and they would go up to NY and pick people up and drive them down to F
For vacation back and forth and it was time when they didn't have glass windows in the car they had what we called isinglass which was not plastic but was made out of material
So they would drive the folks back and forth from FL and then he created construction company and in the First World Wa
Went out and built the roads to go to large camp that was here in Charlott
And so my father and my grandfather at that time uh were in involved in laying the putting the roa
Uh my grandfather had seven boys and three girls so they had very large family they all worked on the farm and he educated his most of his children my father went to the seventh grade and quit schoo
But his other brothers and sisters went on through school and went to uh uh colleg
Uh and so they had different positions but the tradition of my great great grandfather and grandfather carried on to the children and my father who was not very well educatio
He went to the seventh grade and quit and yet when he um was older and in business Uhhu
Where he went to school although he never graduated and also the next two higher school
No he he would go they would ask him when the businessmen would ask him what fraternity he was member o
And he would always say Hodskins which was the name of the school where he where wen
And they'd say What Greek letter is that and he'd say It's not Greek it's Southern Hodskins fraternit
And he would rent out the mule for people to plow their gardens and they would be so frustrated they would take the mule off to plow their garden and the mule wouldn't do anythin
And he was good at doing things with his hands and some business but he took lot tried to be banker and he couldn't be banker because he built homes for people then financed the home
And when the Depression came along back in the 1930's uh all those homes were taken over by the banks and he was left without anything and he was destitut
And he named the streets in the community for his children he named the name the name of the community was Thomasborough which he named after the famil
And the women would prepare for the workers and maybe they would have 50 workers come back and eat lunch behind the um hous
Out on the grass so when my grandmother and grandfather died the oldest son came throug
He took the dinner bell and carried it off to his house he never used the dinner bell but it was large bell like church bel
Uh they met together as community and they founded church and they met in place called the Canner
They built large building put in pots to cook with and the people who had local farms could go ther
It seems don't know much about my family's history tree because since people choose not to tell stories hear people choose to preserve the history and tell the stories so since that everybody here could tell stories about their family grandfather great grandfather wel
That it could have been well that's what was that's what's in it and that's our front step at the front doo
And Lamar's mother and father had it at their house out in the yard just on the ground at tree U
It was the length of this piece of slate so that's from his great grandfather's hous
My grandfather's house in front of the it's like yard square yard and at the end at the gate there is pair of stone lion
Lions seem to be the The male and the  female with the paw   Yeah the male and the female yeah with bal
Or it seems to be like it seems to be protecting the prosperity and also uh just sign of peace and prosperity and dignity for the the family think we have long history but nobody tells the stor
That's because the the you remember uh don't know whether you went to that park or no
That park very small but with lot of of handwriting Asian handwriting carved on on slate too you you didn't go to the par
 Not it has lot of flowers    Lotus it should it should be called Lotus Par
Yeah in the newspaper January 1999 that is park built in 600 and 72 or something like that it's even 1000 more year One more thousand but nobody tells story about that it's just not the tradition anymor
Yeah think so because So many people didn't want to  let their history be know
  So many is feudal  because lot of things like the lions some people were saying is the symbol of feudalism because it protect the emperor emperor or empress In some things so people just choose not to tell stories it seems that as soon as uh the new nation is was established everything should take new look and We just cut off and say bye bye to the histor
The Mama Bear the Papa Bear and uh the Baby Bear and of course they struggled long competent from each othe
Uh also another one was uh The Raven the poem The Raven uh that we read in school and uh we had to determine what it was about and um it wasn't easy at first for us to do that and that that story or poem went something like this Once upon midnight dreary while pondered weak and weary over many quaint and forgotten lore while nodded nearly napping suddenly there came tapping as if some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door it is some visitor said only this and uh nothing more Of course the story went on for several page
And we were to tell what it was about and uh and uh don't think any of us in that class really came up with the answe
Uh my family did not uh all they told were some stories but but they usually talk about past experiences uh when they were growing up uh when they were courting and uh during their early years of marriage and uh this kind of thin
can remember uh some of those stories now uh my mother would tell the story of my uh great grandmother my grandmother sitting in the door of living room when uh my daddy would go to see her before they got married and and of course she would sit there until they leave and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet she would
In other words went to the conclusion that there was strict supervision of of teenagers uh while they were under the influence of their parent
I've been to uh to counseling conferences at University of Michigan no it was at Michigan State University at East Lansing M
And of course the goal of this uh these sessions was to help individuals to become more familiar with uh some of the uh concerns and problems that uh they may have due to language uh new country and ability to uh interpret what's happening around the
Um we had lot of good speakers and we had representation from uh large number of different ethnic groups and uh this proved to be very beneficial and the most important thing to me was while was there read in the library a book that listed scholarships that have been listed and given out by the Foundation and they listed uh couple of people who were on Michigan State's campus as uh individuals who had served as readers for uh the proposals that were sen
So immediately as soon as possible rather got on the phone and called over to Justine Morrow School and got chance to talk with the director who knew about the uh workings of Foundations and grant
went in to conference with them and went over to uh talk with them in person and explain to him what wanted to do and showed me how could incorporate the mandates of uh scholarship that was trying to get the fellowshi
So it boiled down and ended up working on uh the national design of uh experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh to larger cities in eastern NC and of course based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and went to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like t
guess basic problems in the transition from uh small towns and rural areas to uh the large citie
So wrote this proposal to do this and got an interview from one of the readers who was from Kentucky and met him in Greensboro he interviewed m
In three or four weeks later was notified that had received which was for one year of study at uh Temple University and it offered stipend of $700
Uh this was quite helpful uh to me and also uh while was there received grant to uh improve minority scholars on uh predominately minority campuses which was known as AEP Advancement of Education of Personnel and of course this was given out on four different campuses Bowie Coppin Livingstone and Elizabeth City State uh colleges and maybe one or two others and we would they would send four people in the summer for study and two would return for the winter and two would stay and by doing this uh each person in the group was able to get in their one year residency and continue studie
Uh by uh taking at least one semester off campus with continuous education and of course uh returning in the summer courses that were taken off campus when we return to our respective campuses had to be approved and they sent professor to these campus to uh interview us two or three times year as to the progress that uh we were making toward the uh plan of study that we had mad
OK uh so guess you've decided by now that that did not have it easy growing up in fact did not expect to get the opportunities that received but by making necessary contacts good contacts and uh meeting people who were movers and shakers and could influence my career was able to build on that and uh and to get terminal degree at uh Temple University in Urban Education which helped me when returned to my own campus to move from counseling to uh Social Science Education and uh study in society professor moving into the position of professorship uh with tenure before lef
There is book I've heard individuals lecture upon and I've read some of it myself Why do Bad Things Happen to Good People And this is true everybody does not uh deserve unfortunate things that happen to the
But it is my philosophy that lot of good things happen to uh good people and that more than likely they will happen to good people because they will be on the right trac
Now um uh these these ideas have stuck with me through the years and guess there is combination of stories that I've heard speeches that I've heard and uh and of course books that I've rea
Kerrington speaking uh and he used for subject that for every soul open its own way
And he went on to say that high soul chooses the high way the low soul chooses the low wa
And in the midst is the misty flats which most people choose and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh the low road meeting destruction and disappointment traged
But the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then though we were quite young he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone when test and trials come those words come to me group of words were uttered by that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of and one of them was by Kipling which was If and don't recall all of it now but it went on to say that if you can dream and not make your dreams your master if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim you can meet with triumph and disaste
Treat those two imposters just the same and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things yours is the world and all that is in i
Sometimes when might have a have exploded used other approaches sought to keep my head when it seemed like everybody else was not thinking at the momen
These these are things that that would like to share with and will tell you look at about my backgroun
Let's see my mother taught in the schools of North Carolina for 30 some years over 35 years and my father uh was minister and uh have three brothers no sisters and have always wished that had sisters so that can understand maybe girls little bit better than d
We did lot of most things together worked together we grew up in rural area and we worked together we ate together we uh went shopping togethe
We went to church together and uh that bonded us to the extent that we have remained relatively close though gone our separate ways to different parts of country uh because of that early loving and care and concer
This has helped me uh as I've gone out on my own to be able to grow plants and find enjoyment and relaxation working in that area when can find time to do s
would not want to get anyone to cut my grass and thought they would do it free because enjoy doing it mysel
Which they would go out into the bars think they called it in Manila and on the weekend spent one weekend there had chance to taste the foods uh to sleep under the uh net see little bit of cock figh
didn't have any problems except uh when was getting ready to leave it was in the monsoon seaso
When the cab came to the hotel to take me to the airport had my pull off my shoes and socks and wade halfway up my legs to get to the airpor
It wasn't very long before the plane was in and we headed back to the United States through the way of Guam and laid in Hawaii and California Washington D
So that shall always cherish and it helped me to understand other cultures and helped me to appreciate the uh opportunities that had in the United State
Uh hope to return to work uh the in an embassy level position with some of those that would go on the international teams of teachers doctors and so fort
But uh the Iranian Crisis hostage crisis took place few months after that and was never able to get that that off but had vision had desire to return agai
Well never done anything like this before but hope that said something like that uh will help you to understand what it is like to grow up in uh North Carolina and uh the values that are perpetuated are taught by good wellthinking parents and the love and concern for each other that is expressed in many way
But at that time women were put on pedestal and treated with the highest degree of respect and they were devout and loving to their husband and they didn't feel anybody was putting something on them and becoming unnecessarily agitated uh because somebody didn't do something according to ter
Uh we had School was happy place place for play we had limited supervision at small high school and students basically uh loved the teacher
They knew the parents and of course they had the confidence of the parents and um students tried to do the right things because they did not want their teachers to tell um their mother on the
Because if they did the mother wouldn't curse the teacher out she she would penalize the student in some way and um most students didn't even have to go through that because they did the right thing because it was the right thing to d
And never heard of fights well we had some little fist fights but not with guns and that kind of thing uh until very recently in the area grew up and still haven't heard of it happening there but I've heard of it happening in other parts of NC and the United State
think this is this is the key and missing ingredient many of them are busy working everyda
They want to socialize and many times the children left to fend for themselves and to make choices and of course they fail to make the proper choice
Role models certainly are needed in our communities and uh in our schools also uh because students mirror what they hear and what they se
Uh and if they see adults doing some other things they we accuse them for uh they figure that this is coo
Uh one final thing that must mention is religion was more of an important factor in the lives of young people when was teenage
Growing up almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect but it seem to uh place some fear in their minds some people today think have no fear even fear of deat
They think they're going to come back it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it i
So if we don't people have different tendency of churches and religions Judaism Hinduism  Christianity and then you have Atheis
But if we don't use any of those uh we need something that can cause us to think and let us know that we are not really masters of our own fate captains of our own souls but uh that we are dispensable that we are passing through here for short period of tim
It's important to make our mark in the sand and one way to do it certainly is to live decent life and uh if we can do that and add education competencies and skills that we can help lift someone else then uh we would come to the end of the road with joy and happiness think uh saying that we have helped to make the world bette
He is also living in Lincolnton WV but he's originally from but um mean he's living in Lincolnton NC sorry but he's originally from Buckhannon W
Dad um what was it like growing up in Buckhannon for you Buckhannon was uh uh very small and closeknit tow
It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground that was my own the place where spent so much of my childhood playtime and uh running through the different buildings and structures of the campu
Uh having free reign going and coming as pleased almost because my grandfather was the Dean of the Colleg
And and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh to uh corral me so was sort of free to go and do what wanted you know when the buildings were ope
And uh just uh using that campus as playground to um have war games and and do all kinds of adventurous uh you know hide and seek times and things like that with my friends; lot of roller skating lot of raking leaves in the fall and to making leaf houses and all kinds of things like that is uh very memorabl
OK Um Dad what was it the what were some what are some of the main things that you remember about your grandfather who was Dean of Wesleyan think his name was Grandfather Schoolcrafts Grandfather Schoolcraf
Um some of the things that remember is small office that uh we would go into lo
He had one of those oldfashioned uh recorder machines that uh had cone on it where the needle would imprint your voice onto cylinder con
But uh would always hide is his closet lot in his office you know or maybe he put me in there for disciplinary reason
Um he had about two or three secretaries and um they were always nice and um it was just fun thing to see his name on the door and to know that he was an important man but he was also my grandfathe
Um do you feel that Buckhannon is place that you will ever want to return to live in the future And why or why not or why did you like living in Lincolnton NC so much As far as Buckhannon being place would want to retire in or retire back to uh don't see that in the future to m

Dad Dad um do you remember going to Audra State Park lot when you were younger teenager and if so what kinds of things would you do there including snake hunting drinking of alcohol etc Jess never hunted snakes because don't like snake
Uh we did see them in the water occasionally and screamed and yelled and ran you kno
There was the occasional bottle of alcohol consumed in the water on the water around the water u
But uh Audra State Park was fun place we would get on our bicycles and in our teenage years before we could drive and that was good 1011 miles over hill and dale to get there and we would definitely ride our bikes there and spend the day even walk uh hitch hike and walk the railroad tracks which cut the distance down considerably just to uh spend day in the water and uh hunting uh you know exploring and uh just enjoying seeing new people and different people you never saw befor
OK um do you remember any ghost stories or scary stories from uh around the area of Buckhannon Or Audra Or Sago Or come up with different questio
And there weren't any really except headless farmers that would come out at midnight on certain days of the year and throw potatoes at you If you were walking the road at nigh
Um oh I um asked Linda the same question because we are getting ready to move into the year 2000 new centur
Dad what is your fav what is your favorite movie of the century and why Linda's was The Sound of Musi
My mother made me see all these scary things that's why I'm warped and hairy toda
What is favorite movie since the age of 30 or above Um my favorite movie uh since the age of 30 sure do like The Wizard of Oz before was te
Since the age of 30 guess it would have to be Fiddler on the Roof love that movi
We all understand why you like um Scarlet Pimpernel because it was such an intriguing story of revolutionary proportions but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof Um well my favorite part was the two staircases one going up and one coming down or there were three actually one going nowhere in betwee
What do you want me to say Fiddler on the Roof like the story like the fact that  Oh yeah like old what's his face's voice like to sing like he doe
And um like the fact that um it's wonderful story about the some of the traditions some of the type of holocausts that some of the Jewish people had to go through living in that country and at that period of time and um just uh just uh something in my heart that uh maybe Jewish roots from centuries back or something that uh tends to make me feel the way do about the movi
Um being um Jewish born again myself have that tendency to uh know about the plight of the Jews and sympathize with the
Um Dad we're getting close to Christmas and the media has had such fun time the last few weeks talking about shopping on the Interne
In this new age of technology with emails websites um downloading this and that do you feel overwhelmed with those kinds of terms Um do you feel like you are able to get on computer and understand it Or does it sort of scare you It sort of scares me am so confuse
mean   Do you like computers mean you're going to you are opening new business   am computer illiterate so don't have like or dislike for them because don't know what they can do for m
Do you think that with this business um you're going to have to learn how to do it   Sur
So there's one good thing about WV we can talk about  We got strong hand
 Um we   How much did you say you were going to pay me for this  You're not getting paid Da
OK um what uh what is your favorite show of the century and why My favorite show of the century   lot of people say Seinfeld what do you think about that  No like Archie Bunker All in the Family with Edit
I'm sitting looking at my kitten Cordelia who I've named after popular character in TV show Buffy the Vampire Slaye
Um what do you think about the rise of occult occultic matters or TV shows movies about the occul
Why do you think they're becoming so trendy in recent years Uh feel that man basically is spiritual being first and he is always trying to get to the root problems of his personality and his surrounding
God creates in the spirit creates in the natural and uh man does the same and man's trying to find his creativity of the spiritual realm and feel he's just um the day and age is getting closer and closer to end times as far as believe the word of God says and so the days are drawing closer to where man will be harboring more and more blackness in his heart it will prevai
And uh man will be trying to find uh you know the cause of life so don't kno
It's just um it's deep subject to talk about very broad subject to talk about but being spiritual beings guess the shortest way of saying i
Man's fantasy and tendency is to go into the occult into black magic and the dark side because that's where he dwells and that's where his heart is uh settled in right now and until you know the Lord and know the true meaning of life and your purpose you're always searching in the dark side for the the meaning of reality and the meaning of life always trying to find out about the futur
remember when was kid was always trying to uh find out about the future because of the fear that it bring
OK and also we think goodness for Buffy that we have her to fight back against these evil peopl
Now Um one last question Dad um what is your favorite time of year and why Do you like spring or summer or winter or fall and why What's my fifth choice Hum my favorite time of year is summe
And um my favorite time of the year because uh as kid really enjoyed myself more during the summer wasn't a uh person that got into sports so it wasn't like fall thing or spring type mentality but uh or winter sports so um just enjoy summe
   Repent  asked Linda what she if she could remember meeting you in junior high and why she fell in love with yo
Can you give me some feedback on your first encounter with Linda Stonicker in junior high or high school My first encounter with her was by phone when called her up to ask her out for my friend Tom because Tom was chicke
And so call her up knowing that she probably wouldn't go out with him hoping she wouldn'
But and she didn't hallelujah And so asked her out and she said Yes And that was my first encounte
What do think about Bob Well for the last year year and half everybody I've ever met that we've talked to about Jessica and Bob I've right from the start said that Bob was the one would have picked out for my daughter for husban
Of all the jerks that she ever paraded through my living room or some of them wouldn't even parade through my living room they just would stay in the car because they knew bette
Um his character he's blooming but uh always say that to my friends that he would have been the one I'd pick and I'm happy and very glad that have him for son inla
Um once again that was an interview with my father Larry Wentz who is originally from Buckhannon WV and now resides in Lincolnton N
Linda what did you like think about living there What did you think about living there Sorr
Well I when was little kid didn't really think whole lot about it except that was my hom
loved the house that lived in when was little girl and it was very small and lived on street called Fayette St and it had wonderful maple tree in the front and liked to climb it was tombo
had little have three brothers at the time when was smaller only had two because my youngest brother Jimmy hadn't been born ye
So my younger brother Jimmy and I and the next door neighbors would play and guess really Buckhannon was like very wonderful town to grow up in because there wasn't lot of crime it was just very safe very safe plac
And um at lunchtime what we did was we would go to the gym and everybody would eat their lunch in the gym on the bleachers and they would have they would play records and then the kids would danc
Of course you know was very skinny was cute but not the kind of girl that guys were looking at and but used to watch your dad dance with all the other girls and he was wonderful dancer and really liked hi
would look at Larry and had picked him as the one I'd always wanted to dance with and it wasn't until we got into high school that he noticed m
And was in talent show with my girlfriend and we did modern dance to Pink Panther and after that my phone didn't stop ringing for awhil
And your dad called me and asked me if wanted to go out with is best friend Tom Rigger and said Never This guy was not my type and so he said Would you like to go out with me and said Yes would and so that's when we started datin
Why did you like him Besides the fact that he could dance Well he was very handsome and I um loved his smile had beautiful smil
And he was you know just tall and thin and there was just something about him that found very very attractiv
As child loved it but as grew up there just really wasn't whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that you know was where my memories of childhood are and my parent
And like going home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there wouldn'
What are some funny words that you first heard in NC that you'd never heard before that made you laugh Well guess the first funny world heard was Hey And couldn't figure out what everyone was talking abou
You know they'd say Hey how you doing  And you know we always say   Hay is for horse
 Or hi or hello and so that that this was kind of funny to m
Another one of the things that everyone says here you'll say something to them and they'll say Well They say well lot it's just a don't know what something that they use to say when they don't know what else to say It's hesitatio
went right into the school system and was teaching and um it was little awkward at times and the kids were they would tease and instead of saying you know I'm teasing they would say   Hello baby  They would say Mr
Wentz and a you know another thing they'd make syllables where there isn't even any syllables at al
Wentz And ill to me that is when you're sick but people here say Well was just really ill which means they were upset or angry or something like tha
OK what about Sundrop Do you like it Does Is it drink of your choice Lots of people around here seem to think it is it's a what's it called drink of the god
Um well I you know think it's OK but it's nothing that was that would want everyda
OK Oh what do you think is uh best movie of the century Since it's almost the year 200
Why Why Well guess I well love Julie Andrews and like really love the music that's in The Sound of Musi
In fact watched it three times th this past Christmas because hadn't seen it in awhile and loved it so much that had to watch it over and over agai
   Irish  Irish yeah so guess it would be kind of GermanIrish mi
Do you miss your dad who lived in Buckhannon WV And what are some special qualities about him that you can talk about Yeah miss my da
He um he grew up in WV and he um played football when he was in high school and he went right into the service and he was in WWII he was medic in the arm
In fact was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he went through when he was in the service and and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the in the water and then smack down you know it was very roug
And um he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves the swells were way up higher than than the boat itself and looked like you were going to drow
And the WACs were on the Queen Mary and you know they just had smooth sailing trip when these poor guys in the army you know they were just so sick almost every day because of the the boats and everythin
When we came home for Thanksgiving dinner he had everything prepared had the turkey in the oven and everything read
Um did um where where did you go to college at And why did you want to be an artist Well wanted to be an artist when was little gir
The first painting that did that really remember was finger painting that did of one of my doll
And it was just so exciting to me and was probably only about five years ol
But propped my doll up and had my finger paints and looked at her and did this portrait of her and it was just really good to me I'm sure to anyone else it was like Yeah right But wanted that was just something that really enjoyed doin
The ballerina part never came about but I did go on to college and I um transferred lot and ended up going to lot of different colleges which was kind of fu
went to Marshall University and went to University of Pittsburgh and ended up graduating from West Virginia University with major in printmaking and minor in art history and English literatur
Did you ever visit the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh Because that is where he was he grew u
And do do you enjoy Andy Warhol Well you know that's really funny but don't remember visiting the Andy Warhol Museu
And they were like lived in the nasty little section where all the mills were and stuf
Um who's your favorite artist Well really liked the Impressionists liked Monet and Renoir Mary Cassatt I um loved studying all of the artist
Rembrandt did the etchings and you know that was interesting to me because you know that's what ended up doing was printmakin
What do you think about the current trends in art modern art Which some conservative people might consider offensive and disturbing Especially the antireligious ar
Umhmm well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is going on in the worl
You know and um so you know having studied art history that doesn't it doesn't shock me or surprise me that muc
And I you know don't like it personally because you know it does offend me what what have seen and don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art but um again that that's you know is art reflects what's going on and art is is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says you know something about God or not there there has very spiritual quality about i
watched special on Norman Rockwell the other night on PBS and some consider him not an artist but just an illustrato
What are your comments on that Well that is a statement that I've heard used in art lo
I personally was accused of being an illustrator which it's interesting that would even use the word accuse because it seems like there is lot of prejudice in art and of what people say is art with quotation marks around i
It it is art and it is wonderful art and he has captured whole era you know he captured people and and people that who you could look into their faces and you could tell everything about the
You know so people in my field in my experience when was in college one of the things that exp you know had to deal with was other people's opinion of what art is and especially my instructors saying You need to be more cryptic or You need to be more esoteric your art is too transparent or too happy You know well that's m
All writers have to be suicidal in order to be considered brilliant I'm so sick of tha
Why does everyone have kill their selves or be moody just to be considered good writer or artist Well one of the things the art world is looking for is you know um emotio
Art art whether it's writing or or um drama or visual or music you know there's term that Shakespeare use
And guess even in writing um there's so many unhappy people in the world and it seems like you know when they read something and can relate to it then they get some kind of release or relief in their emotions by identifying with it and that could be why there seems to be such demand for that sort of thin
And uh but on the other hand there's the happy people you know and am one of the
I'm just happy person and my art reflects that and think that I you know love to read stories that are written and everything that also you know have good moral background to them and something where you can learn something of value and virtue in it like Louisa May Alcott you know her work love her wor
Again her name's Linda Wentz and she's my step mom who lives quick 45 minutes away from Charlotte in Lincolnton N
Chris can you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as child Probably the most uh wellknown books would be the uh uh series of books called uh Meet and then it would give nam
For example Meet Andrew Jackson or Meet Daniel Boone or George Washington uh things like tha
Why were they special Well was always interested in biography as kid um so guess because they told me about things people personalitie
I've always had had an interest in history so it was chance to learn more about peopl
So it's uh it's the history historical part and learning about the historical people that interested you the most Probably the biography you know the people and the times they lived i
It's a it was good way to find out what was going on outside the world that was living i
think they were just all interesting books uh you know had whole collection them and only got rid of them when was in high schoo
But um you know they were interesting and they talked about the not just the famous persons but they also talked about um you know the times they lived in and things like tha
special feelings when you read them or Just tried to imagine what life was like in those time
Oh see so you would like go into the imagination go into the imagination of Yea
this is what it must have been like being this person or living at that time or Yeah or knowing some thing
Can you remember some uh any other stories that you might have read or stories your family someone maybe in your family told you Um H
Hi Do you need the room YeahBREAK Can you think of any stories that um that you remember from growing up or anyone in the family telling you Anyone in your family telling stories The only story might remember would be um as got older um you know asking folks what it was like uh living in France during the Nazi occupation what it was like growing up before that and that type of thin
So maybe asking her what it was like growing up in New York City before WW II or during the War or that type of thin
But as rule storytelling was not something that grew up with like some traditions and some cultures and some places there were Righ
Was it difficult Do they do they uh share about what their homeland was like What France was like Dad doesn't talk too much about what life was like other than talking about how good times were before the Wa
Mom remembers lot of stuff but uh you know details of everyday life but uh she also remembers lot about the Great Depression and then the rationing during the Second World War and things like that but she doesn't go into much detail eithe
Do they ever talk about good memories they had back then Uh they have some good memories but it's just not talked about perio
Just I didn't not grow up in tradition where storytelling about life you know or heroics uh were talked about or it just you have to pry people's information guess pull from their informatio
Um just that um you know that as far as you know stories you know most of the stories I you know if remember anything it's about the books read and stuf
Your family didn't talk much around the dinner table about stories Well we talked about what happened during your day and you know what happened at school what happened at work but as rule um and maybe that's because for you know from the time was 10 um you know didn't have any cousins living nearby and aunts and uncles and grandparent
My mother's parents were both dead by that time well before was born and so never knew my mother's parents and there would have been stories maybe ther
Uh when was 10 moved away from my grandfather who already uh think he was already dead by that time and my grandmother was definitely you know way away and we didn't talk to he
Where did she live In NY but we were in NC by this time so OK O
So maybe you know it was just you know you know when would physically see her for while it was like once yea
So you are native Charlottean Until moved to Gaston County which was seven or eight years ag
still feel like live there since Gaston County is only five minutes next door to Charlott
Didn't used to be so dangerous to drive and now it is very dangerous to driv
So was named after each grandmother and Mama liked Tammy and stuck it in the middl
lay my head down on the desk and cried because had to learn how to write long name and everyone else's was shor
I'd been writing Tammy Watkins could read and write before went to school because Mama had lot of time to spend with m
So hid it under the bushes on the way to the bus and pick it up on the way hom
When grew up wondered why Why you want to be something that was so inhuman Why do you say that Well guy's are all right as long as they're your friend
Swinging swing as far as it would go and jump out of it and see who could jump the farthes
Or we'd take the swing and pull the swing out all the way around until it until it dunked and we'd swing all the way around the top of i
We dig a we dug an underground cavern out of the mud one time and stole bunch of stuff from all the houses aroun
We played in it couple of years until the parents found out and then they had fit they said we could have smothered to death if it fell in or rained or anythin
used to love to go up to my Aunt Sandra's house because she had three boys and she'd let us run wild through the neighborhoo
When was at home with Mama and Daddy wouldn't even let me out of the yar
Sandra was scared to death when it was time for Mama to come pick me up because I'd be muddy and dirty from head to to
And she said she was always playing with me that and she said she never worried about them hurting m
She said that was up in tree or something and she told me to come to he
And she started started pulling me or something don't remember exactly so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got backed back into the hous
And wouldn't come in because knew was going to get whipping for climbing up in that tre
guess she bribed me to come in with some candy and and then she tore my tail u
She said it still didn't stop me from hanging around with the dogs or anything she felt like they because protected me could stay out in the yard for hours and she'd check on me like every 15 minutes and was taken care o
And we went into the woods and there was bunch of vines that covered like blanke
And took Mama out there one time and asked her if she'd spend the day with m
Just one time because she always worked she didn't have much time to spend with u
And uh one of his guys buddies that was with him just got sick and ended up in the hospita
hung around with uh one girl and um two guys and then later we uh had another girl join our grou
hung around with them boys from the fourth grade on up to through to high schoo
But when Mama left Daddy and everything and we moved away and then moved back still went to school with the
Where they live   They lived in um Black Mountain for long time and then they moved to another mountai
know Earl use to take y'all to the beach didn't he Yeah we went every weekend to the beac
And she'd take me to uh not not every year but there were some years she'd take me to day camp because she wanted me to play with kids my age and she didn't have an
Because all my boy cousins got to go up there and stay every summer too for wee
And then she couldn't pay for them anymore so started working in the stables to continue the
used to skip school during junior high and steal pony and return it and go back hom

This is conversation between Denise Slavich and her mother Fran Worthington on February 16 year 200
And Mom what what would you like to talk about today Oh when was little gir
And was an only child the reason being that know now she was probably an RH Negative person because she had had one child stillborn three years before was born and miscarried in her seventh or eighth month when was uh six years before was bor
And her comment was Watch me So she kept trying and got pregnant with me and carried me to full term and so since she was and my dad were both much older was terribly spoiled bra
Because was their only child and they knew was going to be their only child and within reason got just about anything wanted that they could afford go
Oh wow But um being an only child was sort of lonely life but it was interesting because spent lot of time with grownup
He was railroad engineer and he was working on the down on the Pee Dee River in SC and got malaria and die
And um then my grandmother died when was three years old so never really really knew he
And didn't think about it until the grandchildren started coming along and we were thinking about what to call people and it suddenly popped in my mind that's what my grandmother's name was Mama Fran
So since he was 45 when was born all my first cousins had children older than wa
So would go out and see my second cousins not my first cousins because they were all old people as far as was concerne
But when was think one of my earliest recollections was when was three years old Mama and Daddy and went down to to F
And remember going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those Godawful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like was in vacuum when was walking could hear my feet in my ears Going clunk clunk clunk Was it one of the swim caps with the flowers No it didn't have flowers just the swim caps with the the strap that hooked all the way unde
And no matter what you did your hair still got wet think you were supposed to be totally vacuumproof and all that stuff But it still got we
But that's one of the memories have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and going clunk clunk clunk as was walking across and then going swimmin
So every summer up until was probably six or seven we spent the entire summer down at at uh Carolina Beac
And would get so tan mean would just get absolutely totally dark brown And my mother would say to me Frances Jeanette If you get any darker they're going to make you sit in the back of the bus Oh my gosh Because that was when segregation was still on and at the uh department stores they had separate water fountains and separate bathrooms for colored and whit
And when you rode on bus the colored had to sit in the back and the white people sat in the fron
Wow And we had a a uh colored maid who came gosh about twice week whose name was Carri
So um we lived on Fort Bragg Rd which at that point was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Brag
And with all the added construction and all that from six in the morning until nine it was bumpertobumper traffic on this little twolane road going to Fort Brag
From four o'clock until seven coming back it was bumpertobumper traffic coming back from Fort Brag
So you couldn't cross the street you couldn't turn in or turn out or anything it was just really really crazy because they were doing such incredible construction out ther
And remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half the first the top semicircle was black so that when if you went out at night the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahea
Everybody had window shades you didn't have blinds back then but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb u
Not that they ever did or    I don't think  they ever planned on it but everyone was quite sure that that was going to happe
Yeah it does but yet yet there's they have found evidence that there were um uh submarines off the coast down in Wilmingto
You always peeled off the aluminum and made great big balls for that was the earliest recyclin
Everyone saved all their tin cans um and crushed them and put took them to be recycled and be reuse
There was rationing of gas um sugar flour any of of the real uh staple things that lot of people would use lot of if they coul
You got booklet of stamps every month and several pages would be for gas and several pages would be for flour or for butter or for um sugar and you could only use number of stamps to buy whatever you wanted to buy that that month and then you had to wait until the next mont
And since your dad your your grandfather worked for the post office this was critical job because he had to get the mail in and out and he got an extra ration of gas because he had to drive back and forth to wor
We had um we had chickens your dad your grandfather raised chickens and uh we'd always get them at Easter well you know dyed pink and blue and green and all that sort of thin
I'd get the little biddies and they'd become fullgrown chickens and uh your grandmother would gather the eggs and sold them to lot of her neighbor
We had uh mean we didn't didn't know that was supposedly being deprived of stuff because there was plenty to have because we had all all of your grandfather's brothers and sisters had farms we were the only ones that lived in the city or the town of Fayetteville it was the big cit
But we'd go out and get ham and uh beef and you know all that kind of thing from the
Sausage and pork chops and so forth and such and any kind of fresh vegetables so we always had foo
And your granddaddy had huge garden in the back and he grew never could grow carrots they were always awful but he grew potatoes and collards spinach and green beans and those yellow crooknecked squas
So he he had very successful garden and he'd go to work at probably six o'clock in the morning and he'd be home by four in the afternoo
Well to back up when was just learning to walk your grandmother and grandfather told me that when we'd go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever and so all the the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screenedin screened doors on the fron
And any place we'd go by when was walking with them I'd have my hands up in the air and they'd be holding either hand and when we'd go by any place that had juke box playing had to stop and jog up and down in time to the musi
And my mother sang in the choir and uh in fact that's where she met Leol
She and Leola best friends first and second altos and all that but she knew I'd probably love music and when first learned to walk she said I'd walk over to the piano and reach way up and start playing the key
And she'd put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least 30 or 45 minutes exactly where was because was sitting there playing the pian
So when was four all my little friends were going take ballet and tap dance lessons and wanted to but they encouraged me to play take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town where her dance studio wa
She Mother would cross the street with me and then could walk to the piano teacher whose name was oh gosh what was her name Dorothy Russel
And think she taught just about everybody in town who wanted to learn to play the piano because she had she had this never will forget she had this great big Chow dog the one the kind with the black tongue and was petrified of that dog She always kept him in the backyard so never went in the backyar
But it was it was fun playing the piano and I and then when was six no when was five the next year was actually in the recita
And couldn't play any pieces that where the notes spanned an octave because my fingers weren't long enough until was about nin
But was in the recital and every time every year it seemed like before right before recital time I'd be out playing with somebody and fall down and skin my knee
And mother would make this great big fancy dress with real full fluffy skirt and she'd make bow to match to wear on my hair and I'd have Mercurochrome scabs on both knee
Because since didn't have any brothers or sisters to play with we lived right next door to Westlawn Elementary School and when started school the bell would start ringing and could leave the house and run across the playground and get there before it stoppe
But I'd come home from school every afternoon and sit down and had to practice the piano for an hour and then people would knock on the door and they'd say Mr
Williams can Frances come out to play And she'd say No there she's practicing her pian
Wait for another hour and then she can But played out on the on the playground because we had swings and we had tennis courts and up until was about 12 played tackle footbal
And we had basketball goals and played basketball with the guys which was detrimental because at that point when you girls basketball rules were different from boy
The guards could not cross the centerline and the forwards could not come back across the centerline eithe
You had to stop at the centerline and pass it over to forward which was very unwieldy Now they mean forget when they changed the rules but finally they started playing by boys rule
So when you played with the boys that would mess you up for playing with the girls Yea
Well much preferred playing with the boys because liked to dribble all the way around and go up for layup or somethin
But uh that that was fun and let's see What did you guys in in in your family with a with Grandma and Granddaddy mean what kind of trips did you take when you were little Oh let's see one time we went up to oh to the Skyline D
We went up your dad your grandfather was trying desperately to get back in the arm
And we went down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldn't do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to come back and go up to the Pentago
So we drove up to Washington and he went to the Pentagon and tried really hard for them to take him back and they said that what he was doing with the post office was in the best interest of the government and the country and he could serve much better by getting the mail to the soldier
So they told him No but while we were up there it was Easter weekend and rolled Easter eggs on the White House law
And then coming back we came back through Roanoke VA and then were on the Skyline Drive and Daddy said We're going to go to Roanoke and there's Roanoke Mountain there Or Roan Mountain anyway there's supposed to be mountain right in the middle of Roanok
So was thinking having looked at all my books school books that it was going to be like the Rockie
And was so disappointed when we got there because we drove up and up and said Well where's the mountain Daddy And he said We're on it and it was of course covered with trees and there were no rocks and there was no snow and was so disappointe
Yeah but then we after we left Roanoke we did get on the Skyline Drive and it was absolutely beautiful view but there just weren't any mountains with rocks on the
lot of times most guess most of the traveling we did was from Fayetteville down to the beac
And uh oh I've got to tell you Remember the the birthmark have on my leg Looks for birthmark It's that little brown spo
 CocaCola mark   Because  when she was pregnant with me she and Daddy would go down to the beach because again for her sinus condition the salt air was really good for her and she said that Daddy would not stop because she wanted to stop and get CocaCola and he wouldn't sto
And she held her hands right behind her knees don't know why but just in anxiety or something so he would stop and get her Cok
It was small town that's grown lot since then but we had lot of fun with all my friends riding bicycles and just hanging out togethe
They'd come over and we'd just hang out in the driveway and roller skate or play with their dogs or whateve
Yeah got Fifi when was gosh four or five and that poor dog was one put her through so much I'd dress her up in doll clothes and make her ride in in the doll carriage and I'd pick her up with her front paws and make her dance with me and we'd walk all over the plac
And but the only time was really really um lonely was the year that we had the polio epidemi
And that started think that was in gosh '46 or '47 and uh everybody was quarantine
You couldn't go children could not go downtown and and this was long before Salk ever did the vaccine and with the polio epidemic when people got Polio they had to be put in iron lungs that would breathe for the
They were they were great big uh metal tubes that opened uh and the only thing you could see was uh your head and your fee
And it was pressurized so it would make you breathe in and out because they really were paralyze
But anyway everybody was quarantined we could children had could not go out of their own yard they we couldn't go to church couldn't go to movies we couldn't go anywher
could ride in the car with with Mother and Daddy we'd go for Sunday afternoon drive or something but had nobody to play wit
But fortunately there was a another only child girl who lived right across the street from u
So her name was Joy Teeter and she would come out on the sidewalk with her dolls and I'd come out on the sidewalk with my dolls and we'd play dolls together across the street from each other Across the street Yea
And we'd also we'd draw hopscotch things on the the sidewalk and play hopscotch together and you know just any kind of little games we could devis
How long were you quarantined think it started right after school was out in May and until school started the following Septembe
Was it scary any time you would get the sniffles or No was always healthy so nothing happened but several people in in town did get polio and and had to spend time in the Iron Lung as they called i
Did they recover or was it fatal think they all recovered but couple of them had a recur recurring touch of paralysi
We were just pissed off because we couldn't go play with anybody else or see anybody or anythin
What did your parents do during that time mean to make it more fun for you or Oh bought me lots of coloring books and uh Mother made clothes for my baby dolls and uh we'd like said we'd go for rides it was long way out from Fayetteville to Fort Bragg at the point in time and now there's you know they they're have the same uh boundary but we'd ride out and listen to on every Sunday afternoon the army band had band concer
And we'd ride out and I'd have to stay in the car but we'd ride out and Daddy would park and we'd roll down the windows so could hear the ban
And obviously we didn't nobody had TV it wasn't nobody had it at that point in time so listened to the radio lo
The The Green Hornet and The Phantom and Big John and Sparky and Amos and and Andy and uh Fibber McGee and Molly an
There were lot of radio shows um uh oh shoot what's his name the guy that just died not recently not too long ago the uh the comic the one who did Oh God Oh um Long pause George Burn
What yeah what what would you read Oh all the Nancy Drew books and all the um read lot of sports books about football and baseball and Mother would go to the library and just bring home whole stack of the
So did lot of reading and uh playing out in the yard I'd help when Daddy would come home I'd help him out in the garde
So I really didn't lack for things to do but they just were sort of lonely thing
How did your mom feel about you being tomboy She well she said was her little girl and was was Daddy's little bo
or little tomboy because he taught me how to he was he was sort of jackofalltrades so he did lot of he built when we had the chickens he built the chicken house
He'd bring home all the twobyfours and the siding and the shingles and stuff and he'd build them all himsel
And then I graduated to nailing this and that and sawing this and that and so fort
And one time he was building a chicken house and said Daddy that would make great playhouse for me And so instead of putting it up on stilts like he did the chicken houses he made it into little playhous
It had uh window in the front had front porch had window that went up and down in the front and window that went up and down in the bac
And had shelves and it was pretty interesting little playhouse and I'd go kept all my dolls and stuff out there and I'd go out there and play for hours and all my friends would come over and we'd have such fun and we'd had couple of little rocking chairs and we sat out on the front porc
When we sold the house the people that bought it had children and they were just delighted because they had somewhere for their kids to pla
And something else you probably don't know The house that we lived in on Fort Bragg Road was um very modern for it's time and had two bathroom
But it was twostory house and on the front on the first level you'd come in the front doo
And behind the dining room was little small room that they called breakfast room which was just because they had wall between that and the kitche
Behind the living room was another room that we could today we call them dens' but back then they called them sitting room
and bathroom between the sitting room and the kitchen was bathroom and also the door to the stairs to go down to the basement because we had coalfired furnac
And then upstairs there were two huge rooms one on either side of the house and bath at the top of the stair
So when they completed all the um building out at Fort Bragg and brought in so many troops every Sunday when we went to church Mother and Daddy would bring home at least one and usually two GIs who were there in their uniforms and looked very forlorned; they would bring them home for Sunday dinne
And well each each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared bat
And we would rent them to couples who were just going to be there while their husbands were going through trainin
And that was interesting So they turned the the dining room into Mama and Daddy's bedroom and the breakfast room was my bedroom Wo
And couple of of the families that lived there had couple of children if you could imagine four people sleeping sleeping in one roo
That would be tight It was It was necessary because the guys were going off to war and the their wives didn't know when or if they would ever see them agai
Everybod who had someone in the service had star in their window so you'd always kno
And then if think there were with cer certain color maybe red background and if if the the military member was liked it became white backgroun
And if you see any movies that were well in Saving Private Ryan and when they were showing houses uh people back in the States they had the star
Well when you see it when they show the stateside houses you'll see the stars in the windows and that means that they have how how many people they have in the servic
What else do you want to know Hmm Did you know about me winning the piano competition No When was we sold the house uh on Fort Bragg Road and moved over to Circle D
I'm sure it was congenital something or other because she always had to to rest in the afternoo
Yeah And um when was 12 in October when was 12 she had a stroke or actually blood clot and it went to her brai
And was practicing the piano doing all that sort of thing and my teacher entered me into the competition for Classical Music for 16 and unde
What an honor And the competition was down in Wilmington and it was on the 17th of March The Ides of March and so uh she drove me down there and at that point Mother had had stroke and was back in the hospita
was 12 years old and won 16 and under for the whole state of NC Classical Competitio
And we got back to Fayetteville and went the the teacher took me to the hospital and went up to see and Daddy was there he'd gotten off work and was there and mother had slipped she was sort of in and out of coma and told him had wo
And he went in and told her and she regained consciousness enough to say I am so proud Oh my God And she died two days late
But still have it But was pretty proud of that And then discovered boys and didn't want to play the piano as much any more Because Daddy had delusions that would even go to Juilliard or Eastman School of Musi
But had good time with my piano played for all of the the groups in the Glee Club and the Choral Group in all the little ensembles on schoo
Yeah What kind of clubs were you in Um let's see was in the TriHigh Y which is have no idea they probably don't even exist anymore the High was for boys and the TriHigh was for girl
And was in the National Honor Society and was in the Glee Club and everything that went along with tha
And let's see what else was oh was in the Methodist Youth Fellowship in church the MY
And was when graduated from high school was Valedictorian and also won the um what the heck did they call it The business think it was business award no commercial award for being number one in the shorthand and typing classe
But back to back to my birth mother Julius everybody called her Judy except for Daddy he called her Juliu
But she died in in gosh 1951 Yeah was 12 years old and she died then was 13 May after she die
And so that summer Leola's sister Lucille whose husband had died three years before came down from Richmond to visit for her annual summer visi
And she and Leola Leola brought her over to see Daddy for condolence call and sparks flew and they started going out and that's when they decided to get married and she became my stepmo
And mean it was scandalous So she had lot of talk going on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayettevill
It's hard to imagine grandmother being seen as tart Yea yeah But mean and you know she had the best intentions and really needed mothe
was 12 13 years old and needed woman and there was even talk of putting me in foster home or in an orphanage because it was scandalous that was young girl living alone with my father Uhhu
So Daddy was think he loved her lot but she also answered lot of his prayers for how to take care of me and deal with m
Because had just started my period and was you know having acne and he didn't know how to deal with all that stuff So he needed woman to take care of m
And she was very glamorous and wore gorgeous clothes and dressed beautifully And she taught me lot and did lot for m
Sweetheart wonderful woman but it had she and Leola had lot of fun together and but she was not class
And here was Lucille from the big city of Richmond Who wore high heels and stocking with the black seams up the back and hats and had jewelry to go with every outfit and all that sort of thin
So mean she just really swept daddy off his feet And he was just absolutely astounded by her because she was so incredibl
And when they got married was her only attendant and her son Alvin was daddy's best ma
You're welcome My pleasure Test test grew up in very small town called Dacusville and that's in SC and here's the history behind Dacusvill
It's very small town that didn't or doesn't have post office doesn't have grocery store really only has school and two gas station
But we actually lived in the city of Easley and went to Pickens High School but had also different phone numbe
Um my house was house that sat on 15 acres of land and had um my mom and my dad and three year old older siste
Well at some point my dad decided that uh we needed to have goats so we fenced in our front part of our yard which was probably about six acres and we got goats and on we also had other animal
Like we had pony and we even actually had ram at some point but that's another stor
So we had these goats and they were in fence an electric fence and we would have to cut the hay and bail the ha
Well know could not have been any older like six or seven years old when we had this pickup truck that was straight drive and or that's what we called in straight drive and that was manual shift car or truc
And um was really small and that's why must have only been like six or seven because couldn't do anything els
Um couldn't um help like bail the hay pick up the hay do anything because was so small so my mom and my dad and my older sister could um help collect the hay so my job became driving the truck and could reach the pedal
was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and I'd drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the ha
So yeah learned how to drive at very early age and needless to say my first car was straight drive and no one um in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to driv
We all were driving pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have license so here's related um to drivin
Of course because we had to have tractor to cut the hay and do all the things that you know involved guess in semi quasi farm we were pretending to hav
So my dad taught me how to drive this tractor and thought was big stuff because you sat up high on the tractor and you could see everything and you know could just drive it and drive it and drive i
Well one Sunday afternoon it was early no it was after church um before dinner was read
was out there and my dad said could drive the tractor while we were waiting on dinne
So was driving the tractor around around and around and then got called in for dinner so parked the tracto
Oh our house also sat on hill and think it sat on the top of hill and then the field and the fencing went down and then across the street was my uncle's land and no one lived ther
Over there it was another field that was fenced in and don't think there were any animals over there but it was fenced in filed as wel
So parked this tractor at the top of our driveway and go in to eat dinne
So we eat and don't know it probably takes about an hour and go back ou
And don't have clue as to what happened to it and yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fenc
So guess what happened being the smart little what six year old that was decided that forgot or didn't remember correctly that had put the tractor in park and or in gear and not in neutra
Yeah well remembered wrong so uh went over and got the tractor out and my dad drove it back and don't know what he did to the fence I'm sure that he fixed it don't remember how badly it was damaged but was so upset really thought was big stuf
mean knew how to drive this tractor and couldn't believe that remembered wrong and made that mistake and first was scared because thought was in trouble but then when realized wasn't in trouble was really you know had lost lot of confidence because really thought was big stuf
don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor Well my dad said Get back on it your going driving So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind like if you fall off horse so that's my stories that remember about drivin
OK going back to the whole goat thing I'll tell you another story about the goat
Uh the fence um we had this goat that we bottle fed actually we bought our dad bought the goa
Like all are dogs all the goats were named after TV characters so Remington was after uh guess that show Remington forget now but some characte
As baby we bottle fed him and we had to burn off his horns because if they grow up with horns then they can be dangerous so you burn them off when they're littl
We did that and we played with him basically like he was dog because he was our little bab
He grew up um to be very um close animal to us but because we played with him so much he really thought that he was part of the family and he belonged really wherever we wer
We'd let him in the house and you know take him in the car take him in the truck or just do whateve
So one day we were uh where we were somewhere in the house and like said we had this electric fence and the electric fence works only so long until the goats figure out how to get out of it or decide that they want out so they'll you know endure the few seconds of shoc
So yeah Remington got out he didn't think he belonged in the fence anyway with the other goats so he'd gotten out and uh we look outside our house and we had carport and um the storm door was open and the screen and we look out and yeah he's on to a the car him standing on top of the ca
OK I'll tell ya another story about my dad because my dad grew up in basically the same area we did um real country and he was the youngest of 11 kid
Yeah um I'm sure he was an accident um and you can tell by his nam
Yeah well um well was like said the youngest so his parents by the time they had him were quite older and don't think they paid him too much attention or maybe as his older siblings had to um have most of the part in his raising or upbringing that think he was kind left to do his own thing for quite whil
So he was quite rambunctious so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as ki
First of all even though he was capable of uh going to school and doing his schoolwork he chose not to and he would always um what you call play hooky and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks and one of the things remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time had other people confirm that uh this is true that he would take pocketbook one of his mom's pocketbooks and empty it out and tie it string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for car to drive by and there would always be car to come by because of course this was in the countr
And car comes by and sees see pocketbook they think you know we're going to pick this up and do one of two thing
Their going to either take it which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up or they get out of their car and they go to pick it u
Of course as soon as they pick it up my dad and his friend just would jerk that pocketboo
Well they decided that that wasn't fun enough so they would jerk it little bit and make it seem like it was the wind or just do it little bit where they weren't maybe the person wasn't quite sure if it really moved or not or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and they'd do that couple times and then they would have basically be teasing the person along until the person just had thought they were going craz
And then uh they finally realized what was going on and my dad and his friend would run and they would just run and run and ru
And he would do all kinds of little tricks when he was out school but um as it turns out he um he was quite into trouble his grades didn't quite make i
Yeah he he wasn't quite fond of school and he dropped out in May of his senior year so although he later in life became successful and owned his own company he just didn't and guess and neither did his parents think school was that important so his his stories they always told us didn't involve growing up and going to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievou
was born in NY but my ethnicity is Egyptian male and I'm student going to college and Umar wanted me to talk about stories of culture and childhoo
Well my dad has told me about stories about when he came when he came just to go back and see Egypt for after coming back for so many years and even be before he left Egypt about the quote unquote hicks They're not necessarily hicks they're just people who really didn't know any bette
lot of farmers lot of people who never experienced electricity um went to school and so they never knew things like the earth rotate
My uh dad was telling me story about when he rode on the train this one time and he was sitting next to this guy who was all giddy and all excited and um he was telling my dad Do you think we're moving And my dad said Of course yeah And the guy replied Well no we're not moving see The earth rotates and we're just staying stil
So that as the earth is rotating and we're staying still we're moving from one point to the other And that was one of the examples he told of how much education was important when he tried to explain things to m
It was just that he didn't know any better and that was how people were like in Egypt those poor peopl
When he was in Egypt early on in this time the people's of the uh the parents of the their parents were really strict on you know should well boys and girls dat
If you wanted to date girl you would have had to take them outside the city because lot of their parents their fathers or even their brothers may either kill you or beat you up or force you to marry he
He just wanted to you know enjoy good time with woman not necessarily you know anything intimate but have good conversation with woman and that was heavily frowned upon in the Middle Eas
Another thing that happened would be told me about um was in Egypt you know stories of women cheating on their husband
In the culture of Egypt if you were Muslim when a uh if you were woman and girlfriend were to come over the man would even leave the room or even leave the house because if there wasn't man accompanying her of course the man could not converse with her because of you know the temptation of whateve
And when this when woman would come over it may or may not be woman because this person has left the roo
The uh my dad would tell me stories of people he knew who would uh dress up in women's clothing with the full you know coverings and walk in and uh have sex with these men's wives and walk ou
Do you remember anything specifically Joe Well he wouldn't give me any specific names because obviously wouldn't know who these people were but uh he would tell me stories like tha
The men would drop off the women in there from their cars they would go and park and they would eventually walk together and of course the women would walk behind the ma
Now when they were to go pick up you know at the end of the night the uh women would stand in the corner and the man would go get the car
And the men really pretty much had no idea who their wives were because they were covered u
In the Muslim world not necessarily in the cultural world not necessarily cultural not necessarily Christian  I'm sorry Jo
think it was about well the whole dating thing was around 13 14 so  Do you remember any from when you were around six or seven Six or seven Well that was the hick thin
Yeah I'm sorry Umar was not paying he had left the room so could continue telling the story just so you guys don't kno
And of course my dad was was very strict on education and education was very important for anybody in the Middle East and of course nowadays anybody in the United State
My dad told me lot of times when he was TA in college he had to proctor an exa
And um he told me the story of this woman he would not let take this exam because he didn't know if the person taking that exam was that wome
You know mean because she would it was very unusual that she would cover up more than was usua
The uh professor had to come in and the professor had to get female to come in have her take look at her and check her ID because in Egypt women didn't have ID'
There are two exams that you will take in your life in your junior year of high school and then in your senior yea
The junior year is pretty much practice exam and it's not based upon how well you d
And what percentile you get determines what college you can get into because college in Egypt is fre
So uh last time heard if you made 94 or higher on 100 point this 100 point exam you can go into an engineering schoo
Now of course you can go below that if you want another profession but that's why education was very important in Egyp
In Egypt everyone competed against each other for the better grade so everyone studied on their own and um and definitely had different study practices and mental practices towards education in the Middle Eas
You know stuff the teacher was well respected in the Middle East as opposed to her
